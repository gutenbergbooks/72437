</div>

<p>The services rendered to the cause of literature
by Poggio Bracciolini, have been noticed
with due applause by Mr. Roscoe in his celebrated
Life of Lorenzo de’ Medici. From the
perusal of that elegant publication, I was led to
imagine, that the history of Poggio must contain
a rich fund of information respecting the
revival of letters. A cursory examination of
the Basil edition of his works convinced me
that I was not mistaken; and I felt a wish to
direct the attention of the public to the merits
of an author, whose productions had afforded
me no small degree of pleasure. Being apprized
that Monsieur L’Enfant had given an account of
the life and writings of Poggio, in two 12mo.
volumes, entitled “Poggiana,” I at first bounded
my views to a translation of that work. Upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ii"></a>[ii]</span>
perusing it, however, I found it so ill arranged,
and in many particulars so erroneous, that I was
persuaded it would be a much more pleasant
task to compose a new Life of Poggio, than to
correct the mistakes which deform the Poggiana.
In this idea I was fully confirmed by the perusal
of Recanati’s Osservazioni Critiche, in which
Monsieur L’Enfant is convicted of no less than
one hundred and twenty-nine capital errors.</p>

<p>I next turned my thoughts to the translation
of the Life of Poggio, written by Recanati, and
prefixed by him to his edition of Poggio’s History
of Florence. But finding this biographical
memoir, though scrupulously accurate, too concise
to be generally interesting, and totally
destitute of those minute particularities which
alone can give a clear and correct idea of individual
character, I was persuaded that the
labours of Recanati by no means superseded any
further attempts to elucidate the history of
Poggio. I therefore undertook the task of
giving a detailed account of the life and writings
of that eminent reviver of literature; and being
convinced, from a perusal of his epistolary
correspondence, that his connexions with the
most accomplished scholars of his age would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iii"></a>[iii]</span>
impose upon his biographer the duty of giving
some account of his learned contemporaries,
whilst his situation in the Roman chancery in
some degree implicated him in the political
changes which, in his days, distracted Italy,
I carefully examined such books as were likely
to illustrate the literary, civil, and ecclesiastical
history of the period of which I had to treat.
From these books I have selected whatever
appeared to be relevant to my subject; and I
have also introduced into my narrative, such
extracts from the writings of Poggio as tend to
illustrate, not only his own character, but also
that of the times in which he lived.</p>

<p>I now submit the result of my inquiries to
the public inspection, not without experiencing
considerable anxiety respecting the fate which
awaits my labours; but at the same time, conscious
that I have spared no pains in searching
for information, and that I have in no instance
wilfully deviated from the truth of history. The
number and minuteness of my references to
authorities will indeed vouch for my industry,
and for my willingness to facilitate that examination
which may occasionally convict me of error.
For errors and inadvertencies I could plead an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv"></a>[iv]</span>
excuse, which would perhaps tend to mitigate
the severity of criticism, namely, that the life
of Poggio was written during the short intervals
of leisure allowed by a laborious occupation.
But of this excuse I cannot conscientiously avail
myself; for I have long been persuaded that the
habits of industry, acquired by the recurrence of
daily employment, are much more productive
of that exertion of mind which is necessary to
the successful study of literary composition, than
the dignified, but enervating leisure of the
dilettante.</p>

THE SECOND EDITION.</h2>

</div>

<p>When I first began to collect materials for the
writing of the life of Poggio Bracciolini, I was
much indebted to the kindness of my late friends
Mr. Roscoe and Mr. William Clarke, who
liberally allowed me the free use of the scarce
books which they possessed, illustrative of the
revival of letters in the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries. From various passages which occur
in some of these works, I was convinced that
there existed in the public libraries of the city
of Florence several manuscripts, from which
much information might be gathered respecting
the history of the scholar, to whose early exertions
for the promotion of sound learning I
wished to do justice. In consequence of this
persuasion, I felt a strong desire to visit the
Tuscan capital, for the purpose of copying and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
analyzing such documents, suitable to my purpose,
as I might there discover. But my professional
engagements not allowing me to be
absent from home for the requisite length of
time, I was obliged, however reluctantly, to
give up this project as impracticable, and to
proceed in my task with the aid of such printed
books as were accessible to me. Soon after the
publication of the first edition of this work,
however, I found that a very interesting portion
of the documents which I wished to inspect
existed in my native country. The late Col.
Johnes, of Hafod, having read my Life of
Poggio, wrote to me in the spring of the year
1803, to inform me that he had in his library
a manuscript volume of Letters written by my
hero, which he would with pleasure permit me to
examine, on the condition of my coming over to
Hafod for that purpose. So frank an invitation
I eagerly accepted, and at my earliest leisure
I repaired to the Colonel’s romantic residence,
where I was received with that elegant hospitality,
by the exercise of which Mr. Johnes
was distinguished, even in a country where
strangers are generally greeted by the resident
gentry with a hearty welcome. On a cursory
examination of the volume which had thus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>
attracted me to the wilds of Cardiganshire, and
which was beautifully written on the finest
vellum, I found that it contained many letters
of Poggio which had not been printed. From
these I immediately commenced making extracts
of such passages as tended to throw new light on
the particulars of Poggio’s history; and this
task I resumed at future visits which I paid to
Hafod, till, at length, the intercourse between
Mr. Johnes and myself ripening into the confidence
of intimate friendship, my kind host
was pleased to present me with the volume itself,
which I keep among the most precious of my
few literary treasures, and which I especially
value, as the gift of an accomplished and warm
hearted man, whose memory I shall gratefully
cherish to the close of my mortal existence.</p>

<p>Under the guidance of this manuscript I
was enabled to settle various dates of occurrences
in the Life of Poggio, which were not supplied
by any printed record which had fallen into my
hands; and also to collect several traits illustrative
of his character, which would naturally be
traced in his epistolary correspondence. Other
engagements, however, for some time prevented
me from arranging these memoranda, which I had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
originally collected with a view to an improved
edition of my work. At a certain period, also,
I deferred this task, in hopes of profiting by the
annotations which I was apprized that the
learned Dr. Spiker, librarian to the King of
Prussia, had appended to a translation which he
had made of my Life of Poggio into the German
language. To my great mortification,
however, the Doctor’s manuscript, which had
been put into the hands of a printer at Berlin,
was irrecoverably lost in the confusion which
followed upon the conquest of Prussia by the
Emperor Napoleon after the battle of Jena.
The French version of my work by the Compte
de Laubepin, which was published at Paris in
the year 1819, I found to be faithful, and
elegant in its style; but its Appendix threw
little new light upon the subject of my lucubrations.
My papers relating to Poggio lay, then,
undisturbed in my portfolio, till the appearance
in the year 1825 of the Cavaliere Tonelli’s
translation of my work into Italian once more
drew my attention to them, and revived the
wish which I had so long ago entertained to
publish an improved edition of the Life of
Poggio. For the Cavaliere had completely
smoothed to me the work of correction.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix"></a>[ix]</span>
Having had access, not only to a manuscript
copy of Poggio’s letters deposited in the Riccardi
library at Florence, of which the volume
given to me by Colonel Johnes is a duplicate,
but also to other collections of Poggio’s epistles,
which he had discovered in various libraries on
the continent of Europe, with the first volume of
a selection from which he favoured the literary
world in the year 1832, he was enabled to supply
my deficiencies, as well as to rectify the mistakes
into which I had in some few instances
fallen, by relying too much on secondary authorities.
This he has done in the notes appended
to his translation, which in their substance
exemplify the industry in research of a zealous
lover of literature; and in their temper and
style the urbanity of a gentleman. With such
aid to facilitate my labours I experienced little
difficulty in preparing for the press this second
edition of the Life of Poggio, which I now
submit to the public, with that confidence in its
accuracy, which is founded upon the circumstance,
of its having been improved by the
suggestions of a critic, who has acquired a
knowledge, at once minute and extensive, of
the literary history of the period of which I
treat, and whose opinions I cannot but respect,
as the result of varied information and of enlightened
judgment.</p>

</div>

<p>Poggio,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> the son of Guccio Bracciolini, was born on
the eleventh day of February, in the year 1380,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> at
Terranuova, a small town situated in the territory of the
republic of Florence, not far from Arezzo. He derived
his baptismal name from his grandfather,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> concerning whose
occupation and circumstances, the scanty memorials of the
times in which he lived, do not furnish any satisfactory
information.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> From his father, Poggio inherited no advantages
of rank or fortune. Guccio Bracciolini, who exercised
the office of notary, was once indeed possessed of
considerable property; but being either by his own imprudence,
or by misfortune, involved in difficulties, he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
recourse to the destructive assistance of an usurer, by whose
rapacious artifices, his ruin was speedily completed, and he
was compelled to fly from the pursuit of his creditors.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>But whatever might be the disadvantages under which
Poggio laboured, in consequence of the embarrassed state
of his father’s fortune, in a literary point of view the circumstances
of his birth were singularly propitious. At the
close of the fourteenth century, the writings of Petrarca
and Bocaccio were read with avidity, and the labours of
those eminent revivers of letters had excited throughout
Italy the emulation of the learned. The day-star had now
pierced through the gloom of mental night, and the dawn
of literature was gradually increasing in brilliancy. The
city of Florence was, at this early period, distinguished by
the zeal with which its principal inhabitants cultivated and
patronized the liberal arts. It was consequently the favourite
resort of the ablest scholars of the time, some of whom
were induced by the offer of considerable salaries, to undertake
the task of public instruction. In this celebrated
school, Poggio applied himself to the study of the Latin
tongue, under the direction of Giovanni Malpaghino, more
commonly known by the appellation of John of Ravenna.
This eminent scholar had, for a period of nearly fifteen
years, been honoured by the friendship, and benefited by
the precepts of Petrarca, under whose auspices he made
considerable progress in the study of morals, history, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
poetry. After the death of his illustrious patron, he delivered
public lectures on polite literature, first at Venice,
and afterwards at Florence. At the latter place, besides
Poggio, the following celebrated literary characters were
formed by his instructions—Leonardo Aretino, Pallas
Strozza, Roberto Rossi, Paulo Vergerio the elder, Omnebuono
Vicentino, Guarino Veronese, Carlo Aretino, Ambrogio
Traversari, and Francesco Barbaro.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p>It has been asserted by most of the writers who have
given an account of the early history of Poggio, that he
acquired a knowledge of the Greek language at the Florentine
University under the tuition of the celebrated Manuel
Crysoloras—but it is evident from a letter addressed by him
to Niccolo Niccoli, that he did not commence his Greek
studies till the year 1424, when he entered upon them at
Rome, trusting for success in this new pursuit to his own
industry, guided by the occasional instructions of a friend
of his of the name of Rinuccio, an accomplished scholar,
who afterwards became secretary to Pope Nicholas V.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>When he had attained a competent knowledge of
the Latin language, Poggio quitted Florence, and went to
Rome in the year 1403. Soon after his arrival in that city,
on the recommendation of his venerated tutor Coluccio
Salutati, he obtained the appointment of secretary to the
Cardinal Rudulfo Maramori, Bishop of Bari; and in the
month of August or September in the ensuing year, he
entered into the service of the reigning pontiff Boniface
IX. in the capacity of writer of the apostolic letters.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>A. D. 1403.—At the time of Poggio’s admission into
the pontifical chancery, Italy was convulsed by war and
faction. The kingdom of Naples was exposed to the horrors
of anarchy, consequent upon a disputed succession to
the throne. Many of the cities of Lombardy, now the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
unresisting prey of petty tyrants, now struggling to throw
off the yoke, were the miserable theatres of discord and of
bloodshed. The ambition of the Lord of Milan carried
fire and sword from the borders of Venice to the gates of
Florence. The ecclesiastical state was exposed to the predatory
incursions of banditti; and the cities over which, as
portions of the patrimony of St. Peter, the pope claimed
the exercise of authority, took advantage of the weakness
of the Roman court to free themselves from its oppression.
At the same time, the lustre of the pontificate was dimmed
by the schism, which for the space of more than twenty
years had divided the sentiments, and impaired the spiritual
allegiance of the Christian community.</p>

<p>As this celebrated ecclesiastic feud, which is commonly
distinguished by the name of the Schism of the West,
commenced only two years before the birth of Poggio; as
no fewer than five of his patrons were implicated in its progress
and consequences, and as it was terminated by the
council of Constance, which assembly he attended in quality
of secretary to John XXII. it will be necessary to enter a
little at large into its history.</p>

<p>The joy experienced by the inhabitants of Rome, on
the translation of the papal court from Avignon to its
ancient residence, by Gregory XI. was suddenly damped
by the death of that pontiff, which event took place on the
28th of March, 1378. The Romans were apprehensive,
that if the choice of the conclave should fall upon a native
of France, he would again remove the holy see beyond the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
Alps.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> They sighed for the restoration of that splendor,
with which the pomp of the successors of St. Peter had
formerly graced their city. Their breasts glowed with indignation,
when they saw the states of the church, in consequence
of the absence of its chief, successively falling
under the dominion of usurpers. During the residence of
the popes at Avignon, the devout pilgrimages, once so
copious a source of gain to the inhabitants of the capital of
Christendom, had been suspended; the tombs of the martyrs
had been neglected, and the churches were fast hastening
to decay. Dreading the renewal and the aggravation
of these evils, the Roman clergy and populace assembled in
a tumultuous manner, and signified to the cardinals, who
happened to be at Rome at the time of the death of Gregory
XI. their earnest wishes, that they would appoint some
illustrious Italian to fill the pontifical chair. Amidst the
clamours of the people, the conclave was held in the Vatican,
under the protection of a guard of soldiers. This
assembly was composed of thirteen French and four Italian
cardinals. Notwithstanding this preponderance of ultramontane
suffrages, in consequence, as Platina says, of a
disagreement among the French,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> or more probably, as
was afterwards alleged by the Gallic ecclesiastics, in consequence
of the overawing influence of the Roman populace,
the election was concluded in favor of a Neapolitan, Bartolomeo,
Archbishop of Bari, on whom the conclave conferred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
the name of Urban VI.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The French cardinals,
after protesting against his nomination to the papal chair,
as an act in which they had been obliged to concur through
a dread of rousing the popular indignation, fled from the
city. In the course of a little time, however, they returned
to Rome, and made their peace with Urban by confirming his
election, and paying him the customary homage. But this
reconciliation was not lasting. The manners of Urban were
haughty and stern, and his disposition was severe and
revengeful. Disgusted by his pride, and dreading the
effects of his resentment, the foreign cardinals again withdrew,
first to Anagni, and afterwards to Fondi, a town
situated in the territories of Naples. Here, being emboldened
by the protection of Joanna, queen of that country,
they renewed their protest against the election of Urban,
and proceeding to form a new conclave, they proclaimed the
cardinal of Ginevra, under the name of Clement VII. the
true successor of St. Peter. This was the beginning of that
schism, which for so long a space of time perplexed the true
believers, by the inexplicable phenomenon of the co-existence
of two supreme and infallible heads of the church, each
proscribing his competitor, and fulminating the terrors of
damnation against the adherents of his rival.</p>

<p>In this contest the Gallic cardinals did not restrict
themselves to the use of spiritual weapons. They assembled
a body of mercenary soldiers, whom they employed in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
making an incursion into the Roman territory. These
troops were at first successful in their operations; but engaging
the pontifical army near Marina, they were defeated
with considerable loss.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>The resentful spirit of Urban, stimulated by the hostile
conduct of the rebellious cardinals, prompted him to
meditate a severe revenge. He instantly dispatched an
ambassador to Lodovico, king of Hungary, with instructions
to proffer to that monarch his assistance in punishing
the queen of Naples, for the imputed murder of her
husband Andrew, brother to the Hungarian sovereign,
who it was alleged had, with her concurrence, been put to
death by Luigi, prince of Taranto.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Lodovico, who had
long thirsted for vengeance, eagerly accepted the offers of
Urban, and gave orders to Carlo, son of Luigi di Durazzo,
the descendant of Charles II. and heir apparent to the
throne of Naples, to march with the Hungarian troops,
which were then engaged in hostilities against the Venetians,
and to co-operate with the pope in an attack upon the
kingdom of Naples.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Carlo, after taking Arezzo, and
making peace with the Florentines on the condition of their
lending him forty thousand crowns of gold, repaired to
Rome, where he held a conference with Urban. Thence he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
directed his march to Naples, of which city he easily made
himself master. Joanna, after sustaining a short siege in
the Castello Nuovo, was taken prisoner, and, according to
the directions of the inexorable king of Hungary, smothered
between two mattresses.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>This vindictive deed being perpetrated, Urban repaired
to Naples, and, according to the terms of an agreement
which had been concluded before the departure of the prince
of Hungary from Rome, he demanded, on behalf of his
nephew, the possession of the principality of Capua, and of
several other places in the kingdom of Naples. On Carlo’s
refusing to accede to this demand, Urban, with characteristic
impetuosity, had recourse to threats, to which the king
answered by putting the pontiff for some days under an
arrest. Urban, dissembling his indignation, requested,
and obtained of the prince, permission to retire to Nocera
for the benefit of his health. The first step which he took
on his arrival at that place, was to strengthen its fortifications,
and recruit its garrison. He then proceeded to the
nomination of new cardinals, and threw seven members of
the sacred college into prison, alleging, that at the instigation
of Carlo, and of his rival Clement, they had formed
a conspiracy against his life. Having cited the Neapolitan
monarch to appear and answer to the charges which he had
to prefer against him, he proceeded to his trial. Carlo
treated the summons with contempt, and sent Count<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
Alberico, grand constable of his kingdom, at the head of an
army to lay siege to Nocera. Urban, escaping from that
city, embarked with his prisoners on board some Genoese
galleys, which had been prepared to aid his flight. Exasperated
to the highest degree of cruelty, the fugitive pontiff
vented his fury on the captive cardinals, five of whom he
caused to be tied up in sacks, and thrown into the sea.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>On the death of Carlo, who, having usurped the throne
of Hungary, which belonged of right to Maria, the daughter
of the late monarch, was murdered by assassins hired
by the deposed queen, Urban endeavoured to make himself
master of the kingdom of Naples. Being frustrated in this
attempt, he returned to Rome, where he died on the 15th
of October, 1389. We may easily credit the assertion of
Platina, that “few were the persons who wept at his death.”</p>

<p>Poggio, in a letter to Angelotto, cardinal of St. Mark,
ascribes the violent conduct of Urban to a derangement of
intellect, consequent upon his elevation to the pontifical
dignity;<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and he has recorded in his Facetiæ an anecdote,
which may be quoted as proving the prevalence of an opinion
that he was afflicted with insanity.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>A. D. 1389.—Urban was succeeded by Boniface IX.
a Neapolitan, of the family of the Tomacelli, who was
raised to the chair of St. Peter at the early age of thirty
years.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The distracted state of Italy required indeed the
exertions of a pontiff endowed with the vigour and activity
of the prime of life. That beautiful country was the
devoted prey of war, rapine, and civil discord. The native
country of Poggio did not escape the general calamity.
Galeazzo, lord of Milan, having declared war against
Florence and Bologna, sent a powerful body of forces
under the command of Giovanni Ubaldino, with orders to
lay waste the territories of those states. In this extremity,
the Florentines dispatched a considerable army, under the
command of their general Auguto, to make a diversion in
the Milanese, and successfully solicited the assistance of
Stephen, duke of Bavaria, and of the count d’Armagnac.
The campaign was opened with brilliancy by the conquest of
Padua; but the duke of Bavaria, having been seduced from
his fidelity to his allies by the tempting offers of the enemy,
returned to his own dominions. The count d’Armagnac,
descending into Italy by the way of Turin, with the intention
of co-operating with Auguto, who had advanced to
Bergamo, was also successful in his first operations. But his
troops, encountering the enemy under the walls of Alessandria,
were put to the rout, and the count himself, exhausted
by his exertions, was carried a prisoner into the town, where
he soon afterwards expired in consequence, it is said, of
drinking a copious draught of cold water. In these critical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
circumstances, the Florentines were greatly indebted to the
extraordinary military talents of Auguto, who with an
inferior force, effected a retreat through the heart of the
Milanese, and held in check the army of Galeazzo, which
had made an irruption into the Tuscan territories. Both
parties being at length weary of a contest which was productive
only of mutual injury, they listened to the paternal
admonitions of Boniface, who interposed between them in
the quality of mediator; and, under the auspices of the
pontiff and the duke of Genoa, a peace was concluded
between Galeazzo and the Florentines, on the basis of
mutual restitution.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>When will a sufficient number of instances have been
recorded by the pen of history, of nations harrassing each
other by the outrages of war, and after years of havock and
bloodshed, when exhausted by exertions beyond their natural
strength, agreeing to forget the original subject of
dispute, and mutually to resume the station which they
occupied at the commencement of the contest. “Were
subjects wise,” what would be their reflections, when their
rulers, after the most lavish waste of blood, coolly sit down
and propose to each other the <i>status quo ante bellum</i>.
Happy would it be, could the <i>status quo</i> be extended to
the widow and the orphan—to the thousands and tens of
thousands, who, in consequence of the hardships and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
accidents of war, are doomed to languish out the remnant of
their lives in torment and decrepitude.</p>

<p>A. D. 1393.—In the year 1393, the antipope Clement
VII. dying at Avignon, the schismatic cardinals, still persisting
in their rebellion against the Italian pontiff, elected
as the legitimate successor of St. Peter, Pietro da Luna,
who assumed the name of Benedict XIII.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>For the space of five years after the pacification of
Genoa, Florence enjoyed the blessings of peace; but at the
end of that period its tranquillity was again disturbed by
the ambition of Galeazzo, who had now obtained from the
emperor Wenceslaus, the title of duke of Milan. This
turbulent chieftain, being encouraged by the death of
Auguto,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> the experienced commander of the Florentine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
forces, sent into Tuscany a strong body of troops, which
made incursions to the very gates of the capital. Ruin and
devastation attended the progress of the Milanese forces,
who laid waste the country with fire and sword, and led a
great number of the inhabitants into captivity. The following
letter, addressed on a similar occasion by Poggio to
the chancellor of Siena, is at once a document of the
misery to which the small states of Italy were at this time
exposed in consequence of the wasteful irruptions of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
enemies, and a record of the benevolent dispositions of the
writer’s heart.</p>

<p>“I could have wished that our correspondence had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
commenced on other grounds than the calamity of a man
for whom I have a great regard, and who has been taken
captive, together with his wife and children, whilst he
was engaged in the cultivation of my estate. I am informed
that he and one of his sons are now languishing
in the prisons of Siena. Another of his children, a boy
of about five years of age is missing, and it is not known
whether he is dead or alive. What can exceed the misery
of this lamentable destiny? I wish these distresses might
fall upon the heads of their original authors: but alas!
the wretched rustics pay the forfeit of the crimes of others.
When I reflect on the situation of those on whose behalf
I now intercede with you, my writing is interrupted by
my tears. For I cannot help contemplating in the eye
of imagination the woe-worn aspect of the father—the
pallid countenance of the mother—the exquisite grief of
the unhappy son. They have lost every thing except their
life, which is bereft of all its comforts. For the father,
the captors demand, by way of ransom, ten, for the son,
forty florins. These sums it is impossible for them to
raise, as they have been deprived of their all by the
rapacity of the soldiers, and if they do not meet with
assistance from the well-disposed, they must end their
days in captivity. I take the liberty of earnestly pressing
this case upon your consideration, and I entreat you to
use your utmost exertions to redeem these unfortunate
people on the lowest terms possible. If you have any
regard for my entreaties, or if you feel that affection which
is due from one friend to another, I beseech you with
all possible importunity to undertake the care of this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
wretched family, and save them from the misery of perishing
in prison. This you may effect by exerting your
interest to get their ransom fixed at a low rate. Whatever
must be paid on this account, must be advanced by me.
I trust my friend Pietro will, if it be necessary, assist
you in this affair. I must request you to give me an
answer, informing me what you can do, or rather what
you have done, to serve me in this matter. I say what
you have done, for I know you are able, and I trust you
are willing to assist me. But I must hasten to close my
letter, lest the misery of these unhappy people should be
prolonged by my delay.”<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>The uneasiness which the Florentines experienced, in
consequence of the hostile incursions of Galeazzo’s forces,
was considerably augmented by the accession of territory and
of strength, which that enterprising warrior at this time
obtained by the acquisition of the cities of Bologna, Pisa,
Siena, and several fortresses bordering on the territories of
the republic. Perugia also having thrown off its allegiance
to the pope, had sheltered itself from his indignation under
the protection of the duke of Milan.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>The year of the jubilee was now approaching, and the
Romans, ever delighted with the frivolity of magnificent
spectacles, sent a deputation to Boniface, who had studiously
withdrawn from Rome, requesting him to honour his capital<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
with his presence. With this request, Boniface hesitated
to comply, alleging, as the reason of his hesitation, that
the choice of magistrates, which the Roman people had
lately made, was by no means pleasing to him. Unwilling
to forego the amusements and profits of the approaching
festival, the compliant citizens of Rome gratified the pontiff
with the selection of the principal officers of state, and
moreover, supplied him with a considerable sum of money.
Boniface, in return for these acts of submission, vouchsafed
to make his public entry into Rome; and employed the
money which he had received, as the price of his condescension,
in fortifying the Mole of Adrian, in modern times
better known by the name of the castle of St. Angelo, and
other posts, which gave him the command of the city.
Thus had the Romans the satisfaction of celebrating the
jubilee with extraordinary pomp, at the expense of the remnant
of their liberty.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>A. D. 1400.—In the mean time the Florentines, being
hard pressed by the duke of Milan, derived a ray of hope
from the assistance of the newly-elected emperor Robert
duke of Bavaria, who promised to come to their aid, with a
powerful body of troops. The joy which they felt on this
occasion was however but of short continuance; for soon
after his entrance into Italy, the emperor was totally defeated
by the duke of Milan, and the remnant of his army being
driven over the mountains, was obliged to take shelter in
the city of Trent. By the retreat of the imperial troops,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
the Florentines were reduced to the utmost extremity.
Abandoned by their allies, and exposed to the inroads of
their neighbours, they implored the assistance of Boniface.
The pontiff, who felt deep resentment against Galeazzo on
account of his seizure of several cities in the ecclesiastical
state, readily entered into the views of the Florentines, and
without hesitation concluded a treaty, by which he engaged
to bring into the field an army of five thousand men, which
was to co-operate with the Tuscan forces. But soon after
the commencement of the campaign, the Florentines were
happily relieved from their anxiety, by the death of their
inveterate enemy Galeazzo, whose career of conquest was
terminated by a fever, of which he died at Marignano,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
the third of September, 1402. Soon after the death of this
powerful prince, many cities, of which he had at different
times forcibly taken possession, were seized by various petty
tyrants, who took advantage of the odium excited by the
vices of his son and successor Giovanni Maria; and Boniface
availed himself of the general confusion to reduce Bologna
and Perugia to their ancient allegiance to the papal see.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p>It has been already observed, that Poggio arrived in
Rome in the year 1403. He was then in the twenty-fourth
year of his age. At this dangerous season, though animated
with a lively fancy, and stimulated by an ardent constitution,
he was not allured into dissipation, by the temptations of a
corrupt and luxurious court. We learn indeed from the
introductory conversation of his dialogue on Avarice, that
the appointments of the pontifical secretaries were not very
splendid. Antonio Lusco, one of the interlocutors in that
dialogue, is there represented as declaring, that their income
was scarcely sufficient to maintain the dignity of their
office.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> It is probable therefore, that the scantiness of
Poggio’s revenues had no unfavorable influence on his moral
conduct and his studies. In the preface to his <i>Historia
disceptativa convivialis</i>, he acknowledges, that he frequently
had recourse to literary pursuits, in order to beguile
the anxiety which he experienced in consequence of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
narrowness of his circumstances.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Poverty is not unfrequently
the parent of knowledge, and the stern, but
salutary guardian of virtue. Whatever might be the cause,
certain it is, that Poggio diligently devoted his leisure hours
to study, and cultivated the acquaintance of those whose
conversation might tend to the improvement of his mind.
As literary pursuits had at this æra acquired the currency of
fashion, the character of the scholar was frequently found
united with that of the man of the world. To this circumstance
we may ascribe the union of learning, politeness, and
knowledge of the human heart, which shines so conspicuously
in the writings of Poggio.</p>

<p>On the 1st October, 1404, Poggio sustained a considerable
loss by the death of his patron, Boniface IX.
“Nothing would have been wanting,” says Platina, “to
complete the glory of this pontiff, had he not tarnished
the lustre of his fame by his excessive partiality towards
his relations. These flocked in crowds to Rome; and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
numerous acts of simony of which they were guilty, greatly
impaired the authority of the keys.”<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>A. D. 1404.—On the death of Boniface, Cosmo, cardinal
of Santa Croce, was elected to the pontificate, and
assumed the name of Innocent VII. The new pontiff was
by no means insensible of the merits of Poggio, whom he
continued in the office to which he had been promoted by
the favour of Boniface. He appears indeed to have treated
him with particular kindness and respect. Poggio availed
himself of his interest with Innocent, to testify the sincerity
of his friendship for Leonardo Aretino, who during his
residence at Florence, had been the associate of his studies,
and the companion of his festive hours. Leonardo, whose
paternal appellation was Bruni, derived the name of Aretino
from Arezzo, in which city he was born in the year 1370.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
His parents, though not graced by the honours of nobility,
held a respectable rank in society, and were sufficiently
wealthy to be enabled to bestow on their son a good education.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
In his early youth, Leonardo was incited to a love
of letters by an extraordinary accident. A body of French
troops, who were marching to Naples to assist Louis duke
of Anjou in maintaining his claim to the sovereignty of
that kingdom, at the solicitation of the partizans of a faction
which had been banished from Arezzo, made an unexpected
attack upon that city; and after committing a great slaughter,
carried many of the inhabitants into captivity; and among
the rest the family of Bruni. Leonardo being confined in a
chamber in which was hung a portrait of Petrarca, by daily
contemplating the lineaments of that illustrious scholar,
conceived so strong a desire to signalize himself by literary
acquirements, that immediately upon his enlargement he
repaired to Florence, where he prosecuted his studies with
unremitting diligence, under the direction of John of
Ravenna and Manuel Crysoloras.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> During his residence at
Florence, he contracted a strict intimacy with Poggio. This
intimacy was not interrupted by the separation of the two
friends, which took place upon the removal of the latter to
Rome. On the contrary, Poggio being informed by
Leonardo, that he wished to procure a presentation to some
place of honour and emolument in the Roman chancery,
took every opportunity of commending his virtues, and of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
bringing his talents into public notice, by communicating his
letters to the literary characters who frequented the pontifical
court.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> In consequence of Poggio’s address, the fame of
Leonardo reached the ears of Innocent, who was induced,
by his extraordinary reputation, to invite him to Rome, at
which city he arrived, March 24, 1405. On this occasion
the interest of Leonardo was powerfully promoted by a letter
addressed to Innocent, by Coluccio Salutati,<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> the chancellor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
of the city of Florence, in which he detailed the
merits of the young candidate in the most flattering terms.
The reception which Leonardo met with on his first presentation
at the pontifical court, though in some respects flattering,
was on the whole inauspicious. Innocent observed
to him in the presence of his courtiers, that he seemed to
be in every other respect well qualified for the place to which
he aspired; but that an office of great trust required more
discretion than could be expected from his early years. This
observation stimulated Jacopo d’Angelo, a scholar of considerable
reputation, who had formerly been a rival of Leonardo
in the Florentine university, to offer himself as a candidate
for the office in question. The age of Jacopo was more
mature than that of Leonardo, and a residence of four years
in the pontifical court seemed to give a decided superiority
to his claims over those of the stranger.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Poggio sympathized
in the disappointment and anxiety of his friend.
Fortunately however for Leonardo, Innocent having at this
time received certain letters from the duke of Berry,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
determined to assign to each of the competitors, the task
of drawing up an answer to them. The compositions of
the two candidates being compared, the prize was unanimously
adjudged to Leonardo, who was in consequence
of this decision, instantly advanced to the dignity of
apostolic scribe. This transaction was the means of cementing
the friendship of Poggio and Leonardo, which endured,
without interruption till their union was severed by death.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Before his accession to the chair of St. Peter, Innocent
was accustomed to blame the negligence and timidity of the
Italian pontiffs, and to attribute to their incapacity the
continuance of the schism which gave such occasion of
triumph to the enemies of the true faith. But when he was
invested with the pontifical purple, he was convinced by
mortifying experience, that it was much easier to find fault
with the conduct of his predecessors, than to redress the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
grievances of Italy, and to restore the peace of the church.
[A. D. 1405.] He found himself indeed obliged to exert
all his power, to repress the spirit of liberty which prompted
the Roman people to demand the restitution of the capitol,
the castle of St. Angelo, and of the other places of strength
which had been wrested from them by the policy of his predecessors.
The animosity excited in the breasts of the
populace, by the refusal of Innocent to accede to these
demands, was exasperated to the highest degree, by the
culpable impetuosity of his nephew Lodovico, who attacking
a deputation of the citizens, who had waited on the pontiff
with a view of composing the differences which subsisted
between him and the people, had seized eleven of their
number, and put them to death. Two of these were members
of the council of seven, which presided over the city,
and the remaining nine were citizens of illustrious rank.
Irritated by this act of cruel treachery the populace flew to
arms, and revenged the death of their chiefs by the slaughter
of several of the servants of the pontiff. Innocent, who was
unconscious of the treachery of his nephew, was totally
unprepared to resist the fury of the multitude. The pontifical
residence was indeed strongly fortified; but it was not
furnished with sufficient provisions to be enabled to stand a
siege; and the troops of Ladislaus, king of Naples, were
said to be hastening to the assistance of the insurgents. In
this extremity, Innocent determined to seek his safety in
flight. He accordingly left the palace, under the escort of
a sufficient guard, at two o’clock in the afternoon of the
sixth of August, and after a hasty march of two days, in
the course of which several of his attendants died of fatigue,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
arrived at Viterbo.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Most of his servants, and among the
rest Poggio and Leonardo, the latter of whom narrowly
escaped falling a victim to the indiscriminate rage of the
insurgents, were the companions of his flight.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>The Roman patriots were now masters of almost every
part of the city. They were however soon dispirited, when
they saw their territory laid waste by the pontifical troops,
and agreed to terms of pacification with Innocent, who
returned in triumph to his capital, towards the latter end of
March, 1406.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> [A. D. 1406.] The pontiff did not long
enjoy this favorable reverse of fortune, as he died on the
sixth of November, of the same year.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>When the intelligence of the death of Innocent
reached France, the dukes of Berry, of Burgundy, and of
Orleans, who, in the quality of regents, administered the
affairs of that kingdom during the mental indisposition of
Charles VI. repaired to Avignon, and conjuring Benedict
XIII. to concur in putting an end to a schism which had
been the source of so much scandal and calamity, proposed,
that he should voluntarily divest himself of the pontificate.
With a view of softening the harshness of this proposal,
they engaged, that whosoever should be elected at Rome as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
successor to Innocent, should be obliged to take the
same step. The antichristian competition being thus terminated,
it was to be hoped, they said, that the assembled
cardinals would agree in the election of a pontiff, who
would be universally acknowledged as the legitimate head
of the church. Invitations to resign dignity, splendour,
and power, are seldom received with complacence. Benedict
made many general protestations of his zeal for the
welfare of the church, but peremptorily refused to quit the
pontifical chair. Fearing that the regents would attempt
to enforce their propositions by arms, he strengthened the
fortifications of Avignon, in which city he was in a manner
besieged for the space of some months. Being at length
reduced to extremities, he embarked on the Rhone, and
proceeding down that river to the Mediterranean, he fled
into Spain, where he found a refuge from the power of his
enemies in his native province of Catalonia.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>In the mean time, each of the cardinals who happened
to be at Rome, at the time of the death of Innocent VII.
took a solemn oath, that if in the ensuing election of a sovereign
pontiff, the choice of the conclave should happen to
fall upon himself, he would resign the pontificate, provided
Benedict would follow his example.</p>

<p>This arrangement was proposed in order to appease the
mutual jealousy of the French and Italian cardinals, as neither
of these subdivisions of the ecclesiastical senate would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
consent to sacrifice their representative without the concurrence
of their antagonists in a similar measure. These preliminaries
being adjusted, on the 30th of November, the conclave proceeded
to fill the vacant chair, by the election of Angelo
Corraro, cardinal of St. Mark, who on his advancement to
the pontifical dignity, adopted the name of Gregory XII.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>Though the new pontiff had, immediately after his election,
subscribed a ratification of the oath which bound him
to abdicate his newly acquired honours, yet upon frivolous
pretexts, he from time to time deferred the fulfilment of
this sacred engagement. Benedict his competitor, having
repaired to Savona, and afterwards to Porto Venere, with
a view, as he asserted, of settling the peace of the church,
by an amicable conference with Gregory; the latter insisted
upon it, that they should meet in some inland town, where
they might jointly comply with the requisition of the cardinals.
Benedict on the contrary asserting, that he could not
deem himself safe in the interior of Italy, demanded that
Gregory should for that purpose, meet him in some sea-port.
With this proposal, Gregory, on pretence of apprehended
danger to his person, refused to comply. Thus as
Leonardo Aretino humorously observes, “The one, like
an aquatic animal, was afraid of trusting himself on dry
land; and the other, like a terrestrial animal, had an equal
dread of the water.”<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Scandalized by the duplicity of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
rival pontiffs, and alarmed by the violence of Gregory, the
cardinals quitted Lucca, to which city they had accompanied
him in hopes that he would adopt the requisite steps to put
an end to the schism, and assembled at Pisa. Here, constituting
themselves a council of the church, they deposed
both Gregory and Benedict, substituting in their place,
Pietro Filardo, a native of Candia, who assumed the appellation
of Alexander V.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>During these distractions of the Roman court, the
officers of the pontifical household, according to their various
views of duty, or considerations of interest, pursued<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
different plans of conduct. Many of them, with prudent
foresight, deserting the falling fortunes of Gregory, accompanied
the cardinals from Lucca to Pisa; others, in the
number of whom was Leonardo Aretino, adhered to their
master.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> In these delicate circumstances, Poggio seems
to have steered a middle course. He removed indeed from
Lucca, but he exchanged the intrigues and dissensions of
the pontifical palace, for the tranquil delights of friendship
which he enjoyed at Florence in the society of his literary
acquaintance.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> On this occasion he experienced the most
seasonable assistance from the countenance and support of
the celebrated Niccolo Niccoli. This distinguished patron
of literature was the son of Bartolomeo de’ Niccoli, a merchant
of Florence, and was born in the year 1363.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> His<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
father wished to have trained him up to the mercantile profession;
but Niccolo, preferring the cultivation of the liberal
arts to the accumulation of riches, entered upon his studies,
under the instruction of Lodovico Marsilio,<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> a scholar of
considerable reputation. So ardent was his love of learning,
that when he had attained a competent knowledge of the
Latin language, he went to Padua, for the express purpose
of transcribing the compositions of Petrarca. On his return
to Florence, he brought with him a copy of the <i>Africa</i>, and
of various other works of that author. He had hardly
attained to the period of manhood, when he conferred
a memorable obligation on the learned, by erecting, at his
own expense, a suitable edifice, for the reception of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
library which the celebrated Bocaccio had by his last will
bequeathed to the convent of the Holy Spirit at Florence.
His house was the constant resort of scholars and students,
who were freely indulged with the use of his copious collection
of books, and were moreover incited by his example,
to make the most active exertions in the prosecution of
their literary labours. The patronage of this illustrious
citizen, who had the discernment to distinguish, and the
inclination and ability to assist the lovers of learning, Poggio
justly valued at a high rate. And on the other hand,
Niccolo was so much pleased with the accomplishments and
the amiable dispositions of Poggio, that he honoured him
with his sincere friendship and cordial esteem.</p>

<p>Gregory, refusing to acknowledge the legitimacy of the
acts of the council of Pisa, withdrew to Rimini, where he
was honourably entertained by Carlo Malatesta.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Benedict
was not more obedient to the decree which announced his
deposition. After holding a council at Perpignan, he defied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
his foes, and thundered his anathemas from the walls of the
strong Spanish fortress of Paniscola.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>The well known virtues of Alexander V. had inspired
the friends of the church with sanguine expectations of witnessing
the speedy revival of the power and dignity of the
holy see. But these flattering hopes were at once dissipated
by his death, which took place in the eighth month of his
pontificate.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> It was strongly suspected that his days were
shortened by poison, administered to him by Baldassare
Cossa, cardinal of St. Eustachio, who succeeded him in his
pontifical honours.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<p>At an early period of his life, Baldassare seems to have
aspired to the highest ecclesiastical dignity. When he had
finished his studies at Bologna, he determined to repair to
Rome. Being asked by some of his friends who saw him
making preparations for his journey, whither he was going,
he replied, “to the pontificate.” Soon after his arrival in
the capital of the church, he was advanced by Boniface IX.
to the confidential office of private chamberlain; and in the
course of a little time he obtained, from the favour of the
same patron, the dignity of cardinal of St. Eustachio, and
was sent, invested with the office of legate, on an important
mission to Bologna. In the exercise of this office, he greatly
contributed, by the exertion of considerable political and
military talents, to the establishment and extension of the
authority of the holy see. It is said, that the power and the
money with which this situation supplied him, were the
principal instruments of his exaltation to the chair of St.
Peter. [A. D. 1410.] However that may be, he was unanimously
elected to the sovereign pontificate, on the 19th of
May, 1410, and assumed the name of John XXII.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>About this time Leonardo Aretino was, by the concurrent
voice of the people, elected to the chancellorship of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
the city of Florence. He did not, however, long retain
this office, which he found to be attended with more labour
than profit. In the latter end of the ensuing year, 1411,
he abdicated his municipal honours, and entered into the
service of John XXII. The return of his friend to the
pontifical chancery was highly gratifying to Poggio, who
during the late storms had retained his situation, and regulating
his conduct by the decrees of the council of Pisa, had
acted as apostolic scribe to Alexander V., and was now, in
the same capacity, a member of the household of that pontiff’s
successor.</p>

<p>Shortly after the resumption of his functions in the
Roman court, Leonardo took a journey to Arezzo, where
he married a young lady of considerable distinction in that
city. The event was of course very interesting to the
colleagues and friends of the bridegroom; and Poggio wrote
to him on the occasion, informing him of the witticisms to
which his present predicament had given rise, and inquiring
what opinion his short experience had led him to form of the
comforts of the conjugal state. Leonardo replied to Poggio’s
letter without delay. By the tenor of his answer, he seems to
have found nothing unpleasant in matrimony, except its
costliness. “It is incredible,” says he, “with what expense
these new fashions are attended. In making provision
for my wedding entertainment, I emptied the market, and
exhausted the shops of the perfumers, oilmen, and poulterers.
This however is comparatively a trivial matter;
but of the intolerable expense of female dress and ornaments,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
there is no end. In short,” says he, “I have in
one night consummated my marriage, and consumed my
patrimony.”<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p>Whilst Poggio and his associates were making themselves
merry at the expense of the new married man, the
superior officers of the pontifical court were engaged in very
serious deliberations. Sigismund, who had been elected to
the imperial throne, July 21st, 1411, being earnestly desirous
of the extinction of the schism, demanded of John the
convocation of a general council; which the cardinals who
had assembled at Pisa in the year 1409, had declared to be
the only measure which could restore to Christendom the
blessings of peace. But the pontiff inherited the prejudices
of his predecessors, against those dangerous assemblies
which were so apt to trench upon the prerogatives of the
head of the church. He would gladly have evaded complying
with the requisition of Sigismund, and with this view
proposed that the intended council should be summoned to
meet at Rome. But danger awaited him in his own capital.
Ladislaus, king of Naples, whom he had endeavoured
to secure in his interest, invaded the territory of the church,
made himself master of Rome, and compelled the pontiff
successively to seek refuge in Florence, in Bologna, and in
Mantua. From this latter city, John went to Lodi, where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
he was met by Sigismund, who, accompanied by a numerous
retinue, attended him on his return to Mantua. Thus
finding himself in the power of the emperor, and flattered
by the magnificent promises of that potentate, who professed
his readiness to assist him in expelling the enemies of
the church from the patrimony of St. Peter, John was
persuaded to take the desperate step of summoning a general
council, and to appoint the city of Constance as the place
of its meeting.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The reluctance which John XXII. felt at the proposal
of his authorizing the meeting of a general council, was
increased by the importunity of his relations and dependants,
who prophetically warned him to take care, lest, though he
went to such an assembly as a pope, he should return as a
private man.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> The death of his enemy Ladislaus, who was
cut off by a violent distemper as he was on his march to
besiege the pontiff in Bologna, seemed also to relieve him
from the necessity of submitting to the requisitions of
Sigismund. But the Christian world was weary of the
schism which had for so long a period tarnished the lustre
of the church. The zeal of Sigismund had accelerated
every necessary preparation for the assembling of the council.
Sanguine expectations had been awakened throughout
Europe, of the blessed consequences which were likely to
result from the labours of an assemblage of the most dignified
and learned members of the Catholic community.
The intrepidity of John shrunk from the idea of encountering
the obloquy which would be poured upon his character,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
should he, by refusing to fulfil the engagements into which
he had entered with Sigismund, disappoint the reasonable
hopes of the friends of union and of peace. Poggio has
recorded it to the praise of Zabarella, cardinal of Florence,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
who seems to have enjoyed much of the pontiff’s favour and
confidence, that he faithfully impressed these considerations
upon the hesitating mind of the father of the faithful.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
Impelled by that prelate’s arguments and in treaties, John
took the decisive step and set out for Constance, in which
city he arrived on the 28th of October, 1414. He was
accompanied on his journey by the greater part of his court,
and among the rest by Poggio, whom he had promoted,
from the office of apostolic scribe to the still more confidential
employment of secretary.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> In the course of a few weeks
after his arrival, Poggio had the pleasure of welcoming his
friend Leonardo, who after a dreary journey over the Alps,
of which he has left an interesting description in a letter to
Niccolo Niccoli, embarked on the lake of Constance, and
landed at that city towards the latter end of December.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>Three principal objects demanded the utmost exertion
of the wisdom of the council—the termination of the schism—the
reformation of the church—and the extirpation of
heresy. The pontiff earnestly wished to confine the attention<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
of the assembled fathers to the last of these points.
He accordingly availed himself of the earliest opportunity
to engage them in prosecuting the enemies of the orthodox
faith. John Huss, a celebrated Bohemian reformer, had
repaired to Constance with an avowed intention of vindicating
the correctness of his creed, and of retracting any
errors, of which he might be convinced by the learning of
his opponents. Aware of the danger to which he would be
exposed in defending his cause in the midst of his prejudiced
adversaries, he had taken the precaution of procuring
from the emperor a safe conduct, by which all princes, as
well ecclesiastical as secular, were strictly enjoined “to let
him freely and securely pass, sojourn, stop, and repass.”<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
But the unfortunate Bohemian soon found to his cost, that
the imperial mandate was insufficient to protect a reputed
heretic. He had not resided at Constance many days,
before he was taken into custody, and imprisoned in the
monastery of the Dominicans. Whilst he was there labouring
under the aggravated evils of severe sickness, and
uneasiness of mind, his enemies were employed in making
preparations for his trial, and his friends in vain protested
against the violation of the law of nations, which had been
committed in his imprisonment. In consequence of their
remonstrances, Sigismund had indeed given positive orders
for Huss’s release: but these orders were disobeyed: and
when the emperor arrived at Constance, on Christmas day,
sufficient reasons were alleged by the pope, to induce
him to pardon this act of resistance to his authority, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
to resign the too credulous prisoner to the jurisdiction of
an ecclesiastical tribunal.</p>

<p>But though Sigismund consented to sacrifice a defenceless
individual to the religious zeal, or to the crooked policy
of the pontifical court, he entertained designs by no means
friendly to the interests of John XXII. As the jealous
suspicion of the partizans of the pontiff had foreseen, the
emperor, with the concurrence of the council, proposed to
his holiness, that, in order to put an end to the schism, he
should solemnly engage to resign the tiara, in case his
competitors, Gregory XII. and Benedict XIII. could be
persuaded to concur with him, by taking a similar step.
John with difficulty smothered the indignation which this
proposal excited within his ardent mind. Professing however
his readiness to comply with the wishes of the assembled
representatives of the Christian church, he threw every
possible obstacle in the way of their completion. Being at
length pushed to extremity by the importunity of Sigismund,
who had in a manner compelled him to read the instrument
of his resignation in open council, he meditated the desperate
design of withdrawing from Constance. By the assistance
of the duke of Austria he was enabled to put this
design into execution. That prince, in order to favour the
flight of the pontiff, instituted a grand tournament on the
20th day of March, which was the eve of the festival of
St. Benedict. While the attention of all orders of men
was absorbed by this magnificent spectacle, John easily
found an opportunity of passing through the city gates in
the disguise of a postillion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p>The fugitive pontiff withdrew first to Schaffausen, and
afterwards to Lauffenbourg. Not thinking himself sufficiently
secure even in this latter place, he took shelter in
Fribourg. Here he at length deemed himself beyond the
reach of his adversaries; and in the pride of confidence, he
sent to the council certain extravagant demands, which that
assembly treated with contempt. In the mean time the
duke of Austria had been put under the ban of the empire;
his territories had been invaded on all sides; many of his
towns had been taken; and he was given to understand,
that nothing less than the most unequivocal acts of humiliation,
and the delivering up of the contumacious pontiff,
could reconcile him to his imperial sovereign. He accordingly
repaired to Constance, and in a most solemn assembly
of the council, craved pardon of Sigismund, and surrendered
to him the remnant of his dominions.</p>

<p>The council now proceeded to summon John to appear
and answer to divers articles of impeachment, which had
been preferred against him; and on his refusing to attend,
either in person or by proxy, the members of that assembly
proceeded to exercise a memorable act of supremacy, [May
14th, A. D. 1415.] by first suspending him from the discharge
of the pontifical functions, and afterwards decreeing
and proclaiming his deposition. John, finding himself
deserted by the duke of Austria, and at the absolute disposal
of the emperor, submitted to the ordinance of the
council. After the annunciation of his sentence, the officers
of his household were discharged from their customary
attendance on his person, and he was sent a prisoner to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
the fortress of Gotleben, whence he was soon afterwards
transferred to Heidleberg. The articles of impeachment,
declared by the council to have been proved against John,
charged him with the most atrocious vices incident to the
vilest corruption of human nature. Influenced however by
the consideration of the exalted rank which he had lately
held, and perhaps mollified by the meekness of his submission,
his judges were satisfied with the measure of punishment
which they had already inflicted, in degrading him
from his dignity, and depriving him of liberty.</p>

<p>Whilst the council was thus occupied in contention
with the head of the church, it was deprived of an illustrious
member by the death of Manuel Crysoloras. It has been
already observed, that this eminent scholar, by his assiduous
labours, diffused a knowledge and admiration of Grecian
literature, amongst a numerous assemblage of pupils in
the university of Florence. After a residence of three
years in the Tuscan capital, Manuel was summoned to
Milan by his sovereign, the eastern emperor, who, in the
course of his progress through Italy, was then paying a visit
to Giovanni Galeazzo.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Having received advantageous proposals
from the latter prince, and being deterred from returning
to Florence, by the violence of Niccolo Niccoli, who
had become his bitter enemy, he undertook to read lectures
on the Greek language in the academy of Ticino, an institution
which had been just founded by the late duke of Milan,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
the father of Giovanni.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> The tumult and anarchy which
ensued after the death of his patron, compelled Manuel to
quit the Milanese, and take shelter in Venice, whence, at
the recommendation of his pupil Leonardo Aretino, he was
invited to Rome. In this city his talents and his virtues
raised him to such a degree of respectability, that in 1413
John XXII. empowered him, jointly with Zabarella, cardinal
of Florence, to treat with Sigismund upon the choice of a
place proper for the holding of the approaching council; and
it was with his concurrence that the city of Constance was
fixed upon as being well adapted for that purpose.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Having
faithfully executed this important commission, he returned to
Constantinople, where he was appointed by the emperor of the
east to attend the council as one of the representatives of the
Greek church. He accordingly repaired to Constance, where
the delicacy of his constitution sinking under the fatigues of
business, he died on the 15th of April, 1415.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> His
remains were deposited in the Dominican monastery, and
a monument was erected to his memory, on which was engraven
the following inscription, said to have been composed
by his disciple Pietro Paulo Vergerio.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>“Ante aram situs est D. Emanuel Crysoloras, eques
Constantinopolitanus, ex vetusto genere Romanorum, qui
cum Constantino Imperatore migrarunt, Vir doctissimus,
prudentissimus, optimus, qui tempore Generalis Concilii

dignus haberetur, die <span class="allsmcap">XV.</span> Aprilis, MCCCCXV.”<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>Poggio also, availing himself of this last opportunity
of testifying his sense of the merits of Crysoloras, dedicated
to his memory the following epitaph:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">“Hic est Emanuel situs</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the mildness of the sentence passed by the council
upon the delinquent pontiff, the members of that assembly
seem to have exhausted their stock of leniency. Their
mercy was reserved for dignified offenders; and it appears
by their subsequent conduct, that however tender and
gentle they might be in punishing immorality of practice,
the unrelenting fury of their vengeance was excited by
errors in matters of opinion. The process against John
Huss was expedited with all the ardour of ecclesiastical zeal.
The unfortunate reformer was at various times brought
in chains before a tribunal, on which his enemies sat in
quality of judges; and, surrounded by a military guard,
he was called upon to answer to a long series of articles of
accusation, the greater part of which related to the most
mysterious and subtile points of doctrine. To some of
these articles he pleaded not guilty. Many of the propositions
which were imputed to him as errors in faith, he
defended as true; at the same time declaring his readiness
to retract any doctrine, of the erroneousness of which he
should be convinced. His judges having in vain endeavoured
to enlighten his understanding by argument, had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
recourse to the terrors of authority. They declared him
guilty of heresy, and attempted to overawe him to a recantation,
by the dread of a painful death. But the constancy
of Huss was unshaken. He firmly refused to purchase
life at the expence of truth and honour. After various
unsuccessful efforts to persuade him to make his peace with
the church, by timely submission, the council proceeded to
degrade him from his priestly office, and after proclaiming
the awful sentence which condemned him as an obstinate
heretic, delivered him over to the secular power. [July 6th,
A. D. 1415.] On the sixth day of July, 1415, Huss was
led to the fatal pile, where he suffered death with the
intrepidity of a resolute mind, supported by the consciousness
of rectitude, and by the firm conviction of sincere
religious faith, which, happily for the oppressed, are not the
exclusive privileges of any sect, but bestow their animating
influence on the persecuted advocates of every varying shade
of theological belief.</p>

<p>On the dispersion of the pontifical household, consequent
upon the deposition of John XXII., Leonardo Aretino
returned to Italy, where he resumed his literary pursuits
with great assiduity. Poggio remained at Constance, for the
purpose of improving any opportunity which might there
occur, of promoting his own interest, or that of his friend.
As he had now a good deal of leisure, he employed his
vacant hours in studying the Hebrew language, under the
direction of a Jew who had been converted to the Christian
faith.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> His continuance in Germany was not however productive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
either of immediate pleasure, or of present emolument.
He was wearied and disgusted by the tedious protraction
of the debates of the council. He regarded the proceedings
of that assembly, with the prejudices which naturally
rendered them odious to the members of the papal
court; and the mortifications experienced at Constance by
several of his friends, excited in his breast sentiments of
sorrow and indignation.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> His hopes of preferment became
more and more faint, as the power of his patrons was
diminished by the intrigues of their adversaries; and in
short, wheresoever he turned his eyes, his prospect was
gloomy and discouraging. The study of Hebrew does
not seem to have possessed sufficient charms to beguile the
uneasiness which he experienced, in consequence of these
various distresses. The rudiments of that language are
peculiarly intricate; and Poggio was not stimulated by
incentives sufficiently powerful, to induce him to surmount
the difficulties which presented themselves at the commencement
of this new pursuit. For all the purposes of the
Christian faith he had been taught, and in all probability
believed, that St. Jerome’s translation of the Jewish scriptures
was amply sufficient. As he was not disposed to call
in question the prevailing creed, he did not wish to make
himself master of the oriental tongues, with a view of
providing himself with the weapons of religious controversy.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
In the brief and authoritative precepts of the Israelitish
moralists, he looked in vain for the flow of eloquent argument,
which had captivated his attention in the ethic disquisitions
of Cicero. The abrupt transitions, and swelling
metaphors of the Hebrew poets, though, in a variety of
individual instances, striking in effect, generally shrunk
from the severe test of the rules of Aristotle and Quintilian.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
The Hebrew language was not, like the Latin
tongue, of practical use in the daily affairs of a literary or
political life; and finally, his instructor was a man of no
talents or respectability of character, and soon became the
butt of his ridicule, and the object of his sovereign contempt.
These causes concurred to check his progress in
biblical studies, in which he does not appear to have made
any great proficiency.</p>

<p>The amusement which he in vain sought for in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
extension of his literary attainments, he found in a total
suspension of his studies. [A. D. 1416.] In the spring of
the year 1416, he took advantage of the leisure time
afforded him, by the termination of his functions as secretary
to the deposed pontiff, to make an excursion to the
baths of Baden.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Of these baths he gave a description in
the following letter, which he addressed to Niccolo Niccoli;
and which, whilst it exhibits an interesting picture of a
fashionable watering place of the fifteenth century, displays
a sportiveness of fancy, and an expansion of good humour,
which were characteristic and attractive features of Poggio’s
mind.</p>

<p>“I wrote to you from Constance, on the first of
March, if my memory be correct, a letter, which, if it
came to hand, I imagine made you tolerably merry.
It was rather long, and pregnant with wit. I gave
you in it a long account of my Hebrew studies, and
passed many jokes upon my tutor, a stupid, unsteady,
and illiterate man; which indeed is the general character
of those who are converted from Judaism to
Christianity. But I am inclined to suspect, that this
letter, and another which I addressed to Leonardo<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
Aretino, did not reach their destination. Had you
received my epistle, you would surely have answered
it, were it only with the view of congratulating me
on my new course of study, which you have so frequently
exhorted me to undertake. I cannot find that
the study of Hebrew adds to my stock of philosophical
knowledge; but it so far promotes my acquaintance
with literature, that I am thereby enabled to investigate
the principles upon which St. Jerome founded
his translation of the scriptures. But I write to you
from these baths, (to which I am come to try whether
they can remove an eruption which has taken place
between my fingers) to describe to you the situation
of the place, and the manners of its inhabitants, together
with the customs of the company who resort
hither for the benefit of the waters. Much is said by
the ancients of the pleasant baths of Puteoli, which
were frequented by almost all the people of Rome.
But in my opinion, those boasted baths must, in the
article of pleasure, yield the palm to the baths of
Baden. For the pleasantness of the baths of Puteoli
was founded more on the beauty of the circumjacent
country, and the magnificence of the neighbouring
villas, than on the festive manners of the company by
which they were frequented. The scenery of Baden,
on the contrary, has but few attractions: but every
other circumstance relating to its medicinal springs, is
so pregnant with delight, that I frequently imagine
that Venus, and all her attendant joys, have migrated
hither from Cyprus. The frequenters of these waters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
so faithfully observe her institutes, so accurately copy
her manners, that though they have not read the discourse
of Heliogabalus, they seem to be amply instructed
by simple nature. But I must in the first place
give you an account of my journey hither. On the
first day I sailed down the Rhine twenty-four miles to
Schaffausen. Here we were obliged to pass the falls
by land; and at the distance of ten miles from Schaffausen
we arrived at a fortress, situated on the Rhine,
and known by the name of Keisterstul, that is, Cæsar’s
seat. From the name of this place, and from its commanding
situation, (for it is built on a high hill overhanging
the river, across which is thrown a small
bridge, which effects a communication between France
and Germany) I conjecture it was formerly a Roman
station. In this day’s journey we saw the Rhine precipitating
itself from a considerable height, over craggy
rocks, with a sound which seemed to express the
indignation of the river at being thus impeded in its
course. When I contemplated this sight, I recollected
the stories which are related concerning the cataracts
of the Nile, and I did not wonder that the people who
live in the vicinity of those waterfalls, were deprived
of their hearing by their noise, when a river of so
comparatively small a magnitude, that with respect to
the Nile it may be denominated a torrent, may be
heard to the distance of half a mile. The next town
is Baden, which word, in the German language, signifies
a bath. Baden is a place of considerable opulence,
situated in a valley surrounded by mountains,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
upon a broad and rapid river, which forms a junction
with the Rhine, about six miles from the town. About
half a mile from Baden, and on the bank of the river,
there is a very beautiful range of buildings, constructed
for the accommodation of the bathers. These buildings
form a square, composed of lodging houses, in
which a great multitude of guests are commodiously
entertained. Each lodging house has its private bath,
appropriated to its tenants. The baths are altogether
thirty in number. Of these, two only are public baths,
which are exposed to view on every side, and are frequented
by the lower orders of people, of all ages, and
of each sex. Here the males and females, entertaining
no hostile dispositions towards each other, are separated
only by a simple railing. It is a droll sight to see decrepit
old women and blooming maidens, stepping into
the water, and exposing their charms to the profane
eyes of the men. I have often laughed at this exhibition,
which reminded me of the Floral games of Rome.
And I have at the same time admired the simplicity of
these people, who take no notice of these violations of
propriety, and are totally unconscious of any indecorum.
The baths belonging to the private houses are very
neat. They too are common to males and females,
who are separated by a partition. In this partition,
however, there are low windows, through which they
can see and converse with, and touch each other, and
also drink together; all which circumstances are matters
of common occurrence. Above the baths are a
kind of galleries, on which the people stand who wish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
to see and converse with the bathers; for every one
has free access to all the baths, to see the company, to
talk and joke with them. As the ladies go in and out
of the water, they expose to view a considerable portion
of their persons; yet there are no door-keepers,
or even doors, nor do they entertain the least idea of
any thing approaching to indelicacy. Many of the
baths have a common passage for the two sexes, which
circumstance very frequently occasions very curious
rencounters. The men wear only a pair of drawers.
The women are clad in linen vests, which are however
slashed in the sides, so that they neither cover the neck,
the breast, nor the arms of the wearer. The ladies
frequently give public dinners in the baths, on a table
which floats on the water; and the men often partake
of these entertainments. Our party received several invitations.
I paid my share of the reckoning; but
though I was frequently requested to favour them with
my company, I never accepted the summons; not
through modesty—which would, on these occasions, be
mistaken for rudeness, and want of good breeding, but
on account of my ignorance of the language. For it
seemed to me an act of folly in an Italian, who could
not take any part in conversation, to spend all the
day in the water, employed in nothing but eating
and drinking. But two of my companions were not so
scrupulous. They visited the ladies in the baths, and
assisted at their entertainments. They conversed with
them, by the medium of an interpreter; and when
their fair hostesses were incommoded by the heat, they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
had the honour of fanning them. On their return
they spoke with great pleasure of the kind reception
which they had experienced. When they thus visited
the ladies, they were clothed in linen gowns. From
the gallery which I have mentioned above, I was
a witness of this scene; and I was astonished to behold,
with what unsuspecting simplicity they conducted
themselves, and with what full confidence the
husbands suffered their wives to be handed about in
their dishabille by strangers. They were not uneasy;
they did not even attend to the circumstance, but
saw every transaction in the most favourable light.
They are well prepared to embrace the doctrine of
Plato, who would have all things in common; for
without instruction, they are already in a great measure
converts to his principles. In some of the private
baths, the men mix promiscuously with their female
relatives and friends. They go into the water three or
four times in a day; and they spend the greater part
of their time in the baths, where they amuse themselves
with singing, drinking and dancing. In the shallower
part of the water they also play upon the harp. It is
a pleasant sight to see young lasses tuning their lyres,
like nymphs, with their scanty robes floating on the
surface of the waters. They look indeed like so many
Venuses, emerging from the ocean. The women have a
custom of playfully begging from the men who come to
see them bathe. The latter throw down small pieces of
money, which they direct to the fairer damsels. The
ladies below stretch out their hands, and spread their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
bathing gowns, to receive these gifts, which frequently
give rise to a general scramble. This scramble, you will
easily conceive, occasions very laughable incidents. Besides
money, garlands and crowns of flowers are thrown
down, with which the ladies ornament their heads while
they remain in the water. As I only bathed twice a day,
I spent my leisure time in witnessing this curious spectacle,
visiting the other baths, and causing the girls to
scramble for money and nosegays; for there was no
opportunity of reading or studying. The whole place
resounded with songs and musical instruments, so that the
mere wish to be wise, were the height of folly; in me
especially, who am not like Menedemus, in the play,
a morose rejecter of pleasure, but one of those who take
a lively interest in every thing which concerns their
fellow mortals. My pleasure was however much less than
it would have been, had I been able to converse with my
new acquaintance. Circumstanced as I was, I could
only feast my eyes, wait on the ladies, and attend them
to the rendezvous of amusement. I had also an opportunity
of paying my court to them, as against this there
was no prohibitory law. Besides these various pastimes,
there is also another, which is a source of no small
gratification. There is a large meadow behind the village,
near the river. This meadow, which is shaded by abundance
of trees, is our usual place of resort after supper.
Here the people engage in various sports. Some dance,
others sing, and others play at ball, but in a manner
very different from the fashion of our country. For the
men and women throw, in different directions, a ball,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
filled with little bells. When the ball is thrown, they
all run to catch it and whoever lays hold of it is the conqueror,
and again throws it at somebody for whom he
wishes to testify a particular regard. When the thrower is
ready to toss the ball, all the rest stand with outstretched
hands, and the former frequently keeps them in a state
of suspense, by pretending to aim, sometimes at one,
and sometimes at another. Many other games are here
practised, which it would be tedious to enumerate. I
have related enough to give you an idea what a numerous
school of Epicureans is established at Baden. I think
this must be the place where the first man was created,
which the Hebrews call the garden of pleasure. If pleasure
can make a man happy, this place is certainly possessed
of every requisite for the promotion of felicity.</p>

<p>“But you will perhaps wish to know what are the
virtues of the waters. Their virtues are various and manifold;
but they have one quality, which is truly wonderful,
and in a manner divine. I believe there are no baths in
the world more efficacious in promoting the propagation
of the human species. This may indeed be in some measure
accounted for by the following circumstance.—An
innumerable multitude of persons of all ranks repair to
this place from the distance of two hundred miles; not
with a view of recruiting their health, but of enjoying
life. These baths are the general resort of lovers and
their mistresses, of all, in short, who are fond of pleasure.
Many ladies pretend to be sick, merely with a view of
being sent for cure to this watering place. You consequently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
see here a great number of handsome females
without their husbands, and not protected by any male
relations, but attended by a couple of maids and a man
servant, or some elderly cousin, who is very easily imposed
upon. And they come adorned with such costly
apparel, that you would suppose they were coming to a
wedding, rather than to a watering place. Here we find
Vestal, or to speak more correctly, Floral virgins. Here
we meet with abbots, monks, friars, and priests, who
live with greater license than the rest of the company.
These ecclesiastics, forgetting the gravity of their profession,
sometimes bathe with the ladies, and adorn their
hair with silken ribbons. For all people here concur in
banishing sorrow, and courting mirth. Their object is,
not to divide that which is common, but to communicate
that which is appropriated. It is an astonishing circumstance,
that in so great a multitude (nearly a thousand
persons) of various dispositions, and so much given to
riot, no discord or dissension ever arises. The husbands
see their wives gallanted, and even attended tête à tête by
strangers, and yet they are not disturbed or rendered
uneasy. Hence it happens, that the name of jealousy,
that plague, which is elsewhere productive of so much
misery, is here unknown. How unlike are the manners
of these people to ours, who always see things on the
dark side, and who are so much given to censoriousness,
that in our minds the slightest suspicion instantly grows
into full proof of guilt. I often envy the apathy of these
Germans, and I execrate our perversity, who are always
wishing for what we have not, and are continually exposed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
to present calamity by our dread of the future. But these
people, content with little, enjoy their day of life in
mirth and merriment; they do not hanker after wealth;
they are not anxious for the morrow; and they bear
adversity with patience. Thus are they rich by the mere
disposition of their minds. Their motto is, “<i>live while
you live</i>.” But of this enough—it is not my object to
extol my new friends at the expense of my countrymen.
I wish my epistle to consist of unqualified good humour,
that I may impart to you a portion of the pleasure I
derived from the baths of Baden.”</p>

<p>Soon after Poggio’s return from Baden to Constance
the Council proceeded to the trial of Jerome of Prague, an
intimate friend and associate of John Huss. When Jerome
was apprized of the arrest and imprisonment of his brother
reformer, he deemed himself bound in honour to repair to
Constance, to administer to him comfort and assistance. He
accordingly arrived in that city on the 24th of April, 1415.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
But alarmed by the violence of spirit which seemed to rage
against reputed heretics, he soon fled from Constance, and
went to Uberlingen, whence he sent to the council to demand
a safe conduct. Instead of this instrument of protection,
the members of that assembly addressed to him a citation to
appear before them, and answer to a charge of heresy.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
Justly dreading the consequences of encountering the prejudices
of the ecclesiastical dignitaries, whose morals and principles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
he had so often branded with infamy, he refused to
obey this citation, and set off on his return to Bohemia.
He proceeded without molestation as far as Hirsaw; but there
he was arrested by the officers of the duke of Sultzbach, who
sent him in chains to Constance.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Immediately after his
arrival in that city, he underwent an examination, after which
he was committed to prison. The severity which he there
experienced, the importunity of some of his prosecutors, and
his solitary meditations on the dreadful catastrophe of Huss,
at length shook his constancy, and on the 15th of September,
1415, he read in open Council, a recantation of his errors.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
At this price he purchased a relaxation of the rigour of his
confinement: but, notwithstanding the remonstrances of
Zabarella, and of three other cardinals, who contended,
that by his renunciation of error, he had satisfied public
justice, he was detained in custody. In the course of a
few months after his recantation, new articles of impeachment
were exhibited against him. To these he pleaded in
a solemn assembly of the council, held for that purpose, on
the 26th May, 1416.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Poggio, who was present at this
second trial of Jerome, gave the following interesting account
of it to his friend Leonardo Aretino.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>“Soon after my return from Baden to Constance, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
cause of Jerome of Prague, who was accused of heresy,
came to a public hearing. The purport of my present
letter is to give you an account of this trial, which must
of necessity be a matter of considerable interest, both on
account of the importance of the subject, and the eloquence
and learning of the defendant. I must confess that I never
saw any one who in pleading a cause, especially a cause on
the issue of which his own life depended, approached
nearer to that standard of ancient eloquence, which we so
much admire. It was astonishing to witness with what
choice of words, with what closeness of argument, with
what confidence of countenance he replied to his adversaries.
So impressive was his peroration, that it is a subject of
great concern, that a man of so noble and excellent a
genius should have deviated into heresy. On this latter
point however, I cannot help entertaining some doubts.
But far be it from me to take upon myself to decide in
so important a matter. I shall acquiesce in the opinion
of those who are wiser than myself.</p>

<p>“Do not however imagine that I intend to enter into
the particulars of this cause. I shall only touch upon the
more remarkable and interesting circumstances, which will
be sufficient to give you an idea of the learning of the
man.</p>

<p>“Many things having been alleged against the prisoner
as proofs of his entertaining heretical notions, and the
council being of opinion, that the proof was sufficiently
strong to warrant further investigation, it was ordered that
he should publicly answer to every particular of the charge.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
He was accordingly brought before the council. But
when he was called upon to give in his answers, he for
a long time refused so to do; alleging, that he ought
to be permitted to speak generally in his defence, before
he replied to the false imputations of his adversaries. This
indulgence was however denied him. Upon which, standing
up in the midst of the assembly—What gross injustice
is this! exclaimed he, that though for the space of three
hundred and forty days, which I have spent in filth and
fetters, deprived of every comfort, in prisons situated at
the most remote distances from each other, you have been
continually listening to my adversaries and slanderers, you
will not hear me for a single hour! The consequence of
this is, that while on the one hand, every one’s ears are
open to them, and they have for so long a time been
attempting to persuade you that I am a heretic, an enemy
of the true faith, a persecutor of the clergy; and on the
other hand, I am deprived of every opportunity of defending
myself; you have prejudged my cause, and have in
your own minds condemned me, before you could possibly
become acquainted with my principles. But, says he, you
are not Gods, but men, not immortals, but mortals, liable
to error, and subject to imperfection. We are taught to
believe that this assembly contains the light of the world,
the prudent men of the earth. You ought therefore to be
unremittingly careful not to do any thing rashly, foolishly
or unjustly. I indeed, who am pleading for my life,
am a man of little consequence; nor do I say what I
do say through anxiety for myself (for I am prepared
to submit to the common lot of mortality)—but I am<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
prompted by an earnest desire, that the collective wisdom
of so many eminent men may not, in my person,
violate the laws of justice. As to the injury done to
myself, it is comparatively of trifling consequence;
but the precedent will be pregnant with future mischief.
These and many other observations he made
with great eloquence; but he was interrupted by the
murmurs and clamours of several of his auditors. It
was decreed, that he should first answer to the charges
exhibited against him, and afterwards have free liberty
of speech. The heads of the accusation were accordingly
read from the desk. When, after they had been
proved by testimony, he was asked whether he had
any remarks to make in his defence, it is incredible
with what skill and judgment he put in his answers.
He advanced nothing unbecoming a good man; and if his
real sentiments agreed with his professions, he was so far
from deserving to die, that his principles did not even give
just ground for the slightest offence. He denied the whole
impeachment, as a fiction invented by the malice of his
enemies. Amongst others an article was read, which
accused him of being a detractor of the apostolic see, an
oppugner of the Roman pontiff, an enemy of the cardinals,
a persecutor of prelates, and an adversary of the
Christian clergy. When this charge was read, he arose,
and stretching out his hands, he said in a pathetic tone of
voice, Fathers! to whom shall I have recourse for succour?
Whose assistance shall I implore? Unto whom shall I
appeal, in protestation of my innocence?—Unto you?—But
these my persecutors have prejudiced your minds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
against me, by declaring that I entertain hostility against
all my judges. Thus have they artfully endeavoured, if
they cannot reach me by their imputations of error, so to
excite your fears, that you may be induced to seize any
plausible pretext to destroy your common enemy, such as
they most falsely represent me to be. Thus, if you give
credit to their assertion, all my hopes of safety are lost.
He caused many to smart by the keenness of his wit, and
the bitterness of his reproaches. Melancholy as the occasion
was, he frequently excited laughter, by turning to
ridicule the imputations of his adversaries. When he was
asked what were his sentiments concerning the sacrament,
he replied, that it was by nature bread; but that at the
time of consecration, and afterwards, it was the true body
of Christ, &amp;c. according to the strictest orthodoxy. Then
someone said, but it is reported that you have maintained,
that there remains bread after consecration.—True, said
Jerome, there remains bread at the baker’s. When one
of the order of preaching friars was railing against him
with uncommon asperity, he said to him—Hold thy peace,
hypocrite! When another swore by his conscience, this,
said he, is a very safe mode of deceiving. One man, who
was particularly inveterate against him, he never addressed
but by the title of ass or dog. As, on account of the
number and importance of the articles exhibited against
him, the cause could not be determined at that sitting,
the court was adjourned to another day, on which the
proofs of each article of impeachment were read over,
and confirmed by more witnesses. Then he arose and
said, since you have attended so diligently to my adversaries,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
I have a right to demand that you should also
hear me with patience. Though many violently objected
to this demand, it was at length conceded to him that he
should be heard in his defence. He then began by
solemnly praying to God, so to influence his mind, and
so to inspire his speech, that he might be enabled to
plead to the advantage and salvation of his soul. He
then proceeded thus—I know, most learned judges, that
many excellent men have been most unworthily dealt with,
overborne by false witnesses, and condemned by the most
unjust judgments. Illustrating this position by particular
instances, he began with Socrates, who was unjustly
condemned by his countrymen, and who could not be
persuaded by the dread of the most formidable evils,
imprisonment or death, to avail himself of an opportunity
which was presented to him of escaping out of custody.
He then proceeded to mention the captivity of
Plato, the torments endured by Anaxagoras and Zeno,
and the unjust condemnations of many other gentiles—the
banishment of Rutilius, the unmerited death of
Boetius, and of others mentioned in the writings of that
author. He then passed on to the instances which are
recorded in the Jewish history—and in the first place,
he observed, that Moses, the deliverer and legislator
of the Jews, was frequently calumniated by his own
countrymen, as a seducer and contemner of the people.
He also instanced Joseph, who was sold to slavery, in
consequence of the envy of his brethren, and afterwards
imprisoned under a groundless suspicion of incontinence.
Besides these, he enumerated Isaiah, Daniel, and almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
all the prophets, who were calumniated and persecuted,
as despisers of God and sowers of sedition. He also
alluded to the trial of Susannah, and of many others,
who, notwithstanding the integrity of their lives, perished
by unjust sentences. Coming down to the time of John
the Baptist and our Saviour, he observed, that all are
agreed that they were unjustly condemned, upon false
charges, supported by false witnesses. He next quoted
the case of Stephen, who was put to death by the priests;
and reminded the assembly that all the apostles were condemned
to die, as seditious movers of the people, contemners
of the gods, and workers of iniquity. He maintained
that it was a scandalous thing that one priest
should be unjustly condemned by another; that it was
still more scandalous, that a college of priests should be
guilty of this crime; and that it was most scandalous
of all, that it should be perpetrated by a general council.
Nevertheless he proved from history that these circumstances
had actually occurred. Upon these topics he
enlarged in so impressive a manner, that every body
listened to him with fixed attention. But as the weight of
every cause rests upon the evidence by which it is supported,
he proved, by various arguments, that no credit was due
to the witnesses who deposed against him, more especially
as they were instigated to give evidence against him by
hatred, malevolence, and envy. He then so satisfactorily
detailed the causes of the hatred which he imputed
to his prosecutors, that he almost convinced his judges
of the reasonableness of his objections against their testimony.
His observations were so weighty, that little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
credit would have been given to the depositions of the
witnesses for the prosecution, in any other cause except
in a trial for heresy. He moreover added, that he had
voluntarily come to the council, in order to defend his injured
character; and gave an account of his life and studies,
which had been regulated by the laws of duty and
of virtue. He remarked, that holy men of old were accustomed
to discuss their differences of opinion in matters
of belief, not with a view of impugning the faith,
but of investigating the truth—that St. Augustine and
St. Jerome had thus differed in opinion, and had upon
some points even held contrary sentiments, without any
suspicion of heresy. All the audience entertained hopes
that he would either clear himself by retracting the
heresies which were objected to him, or supplicate pardon
for his errors. But he maintained that he had not
erred, and that therefore he had nothing to retract. He
next began to praise John Huss, who had been condemned
to the flames, calling him a good, just, and
holy man, a man who had suffered death in a righteous
cause. He professed that he himself also was prepared
to undergo the severest punishment with an undaunted
and constant mind, declaring that he submitted to his
enemies, and to witnesses who had testified such shameful
falsehoods; who would however, on some future
day, give an account of what they had said, to a God
who could not be deceived. When Jerome made these
declarations, the assembly was affected with the greatest
sorrow; for every body wished, that a man of such
extraordinary talents should repent of his errors and be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
saved. But he persisted in his sentiments, and seemed
to court destruction. Dwelling on the praises of John
Huss, he said, that he entertained no principles hostile
to the constitution of the holy church, and that he only
bore testimony against the abuses of the clergy, and
the pride and pomp of prelates: for that since the
patrimony of the church was appropriated first to the
poor, then to strangers, and lastly to the erection of
churches, good men thought it highly improper that it
should be lavished on harlots, entertainments, dogs,
splendid garments, and other things unbecoming the
religion of Christ. It may be mentioned as the greatest
proof of Jerome’s abilities, that though he was frequently
interrupted by various noises, and was teased by
some people who cavilled at his expressions, he replied
to them all, and compelled them either to blush or to be
silent. When the clamour incommoded him, he ceased
speaking, and sometimes reproved those who disturbed him.
He then continued his speech, begging and entreating
them to suffer him to speak, since this was the last time
they would hear him. He was never terrified by the
murmurs of his adversaries, but uniformly maintained
the firmness and intrepidity of his mind. It was a wonderful
instance of the strength of his memory, that
though he had been confined three hundred and forty
days in a dark dungeon, where it was impossible for
him to read, and where he must have daily suffered
from the utmost anxiety of mind, yet he quoted so
many learned writers in defence of his opinions, and
supported his sentiments by the authority of so many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
doctors of the church, that any one would have been
led to believe, that he had devoted all the time of his
imprisonment to the peaceful and undisturbed study of
philosophy. His voice was sweet, clear and sonorous;
his action dignified, and well adapted either to express
indignation, or to excite compassion, which however he
neither asked nor wished for. He stood undaunted and
intrepid, not merely contemning, but like another Cato
longing for death. He was a man worthy to be held in
everlasting remembrance. I do not commend him for
entertaining sentiments hostile to the constitution of the
church; but I admire his learning, his extensive knowledge,
the suavity of his eloquence, and his ability in
reply. But I am afraid that all these endowments were
bestowed on him by nature, in order to effect his destruction.
As he was allowed two days for repentance, several
learned men, and amongst the rest the cardinal of Florence,
visited him, with a view of persuading him to
change his sentiments, and turn from the error of his
ways. But as he pertinaciously persisted in his false
notions, he was condemned as guilty of heresy, and
consigned to the flames. No stoic ever suffered death
with such constancy of mind. When he arrived at the
place of execution, he stripped himself of his garments,
and knelt down before the stake, to which he was soon
after tied with wet ropes and a chain. Then great
pieces of wood, intermixed with straw, were piled as
high as his breast. When fire was set to the pile, he
began to sing a hymn, which was scarcely interrupted by
the smoke and flame. I must not omit a striking circumstance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
which shows the firmness of his mind. When
the executioner was going to apply the fire behind him,
in order that he might not see it, he said, come this way,
and kindle it in my sight, for had I been afraid of it, I
should never have come to this place. Thus perished a
man, in every respect exemplary, except in the erroneousness
of his faith. I was a witness of his end, and observed
every particular of its process. He may have been
heretical in his notions, and obstinate in perservering in
them, but he certainly died like a philosopher. I have
rehearsed a long story, as I wished to employ my leisure
in relating a transaction which surpasses the events of
ancient history. For neither did Mutius suffer his hand
to be burnt so patiently as Jerome endured the burning
of his whole body; nor did Socrates drink the hemlock
as cheerfully as Jerome submitted to the fire.”<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>They who are admitted within the veil which hides
the daily transactions of the great from the profane eyes
of the vulgar, rarely entertain an excessive reverence for
dignities. From a variety of passages which occur in the
works of Poggio, it is evident, that he was by no means
insensible of the corruptions of the pontifical court; and
on more occasions than one, he drew upon himself the
severity of reproof, by the freedom with which he exposed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
the vices of the clergy.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Whether his indignation
against the disgraceful conduct of the teachers of the
Catholic doctrine had shaken his belief in the Catholic creed,
his prudence has rendered it impossible to ascertain. It
is certain, that he thought a reformation of the manners of
ecclesiastics absolutely necessary to the credit of the church;
and though he was not inspired by the zeal which prompted
John Huss, and Jerome of Prague, publicly to arraign the
conduct of their ecclesiastical superiors, let it be recorded to
his honour, that he did not, as many have done, reprove
and ridicule prevailing corruptions in private, and at the
same time join in the persecution of those who had sufficient
courage to impugn the same corruptions by open hostility.
The feeling manner in which he describes the trial and execution
of Jerome, evinces a heart which daily intercourse with
bigoted believers and licentious hypocrites could not deaden
to the impulses of humanity. Indeed the manifest interest
which he took in the fate of a man, who was held by the
church as an object of unqualified abhorrence,<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> awakened
the fears of Leonardo Aretino on his behalf. Leonardo was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
undoubtedly apprehensive, lest his admiration of the abilities,
and his compassion for the fate of the heretic, should be
attributed to a latent love of heresy. He therefore thought
it requisite to admonish his friend in the following terms.
“I received the day before yesterday, by the medium of
Barbaro, your letter on the subject of the execution of
Jerome of Prague. I very much admire its elegance;
but you seem to give a more ample testimony to the
merits of the heretic than I could wish. You take care
indeed frequently to put in proper caveats; but upon the
whole, you show too great an affection for his cause. I
must advise you henceforth to write upon such subjects in
a more guarded manner.”<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>The cold caution of Leonardo may be a quality conducive
to the insurance of personal safety; but the generous
warmth of Poggio lays an irresistible claim to the
applause of every ingenuous mind.</p>

</div>

<p>Soon after the execution of Jerome of Prague, Poggio
received from Guarino Veronese,<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> a copy of a treatise,
<i>De Re Uxoriâ</i>, i. e. on the duties of a wife, which had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
been lately published by Francesco Barbaro, a Venetian
scholar, who was now beginning to attain a considerable
degree of celebrity. His opinion of this composition he
expressed in the following terms. “I thank you, my
dear Guarino, for the little volume which you have been
so kind as to communicate to me. My obligation to you
would be immense, had I any thoughts of matrimony;
but I must acknowledge, that the perusal of this treatise
has done away the little inclination which I previously
felt to enter into the married state; for how can I expect
to find a help-mate who concentrates in her character all
the good qualities, the union of which, in the opinion of
wise judges, constitutes a good wife. But to be serious.
As soon as I received the book, I began to peruse it;
and found the subject so novel, the style so excellent,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
and the method so clear, that I hastily ran over the
whole in one day. I afterwards read it again more
deliberately. The subject is indeed a pleasant one;
and he has illustrated it by numerous and well arranged
examples. I am however most of all captivated by the
gravity of his diction. This dissertation on the duty of
a wife, is, in my opinion, worthy to be classed with
Tully’s Offices. You know that I am no flatterer, but
that I always speak from the impulse of the heart. Barbaro
unites with the greatest eloquence a dignity of sentiment,
worthy of a man of consummate gravity. Earnestly
exhort him to cultivate those talents, the first fruits
of which are so admirable.”<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>The warm approbation which Poggio expressed of this
treatise <i>De Re Uxoriâ</i>, led the way to an intercourse of
mutual good offices between him and its author, in whose
character were united the dignity of the patrician, and the
accomplishments of the scholar.</p>

<p>Francesco Barbaro was descended from a noble Venetian
family, which formerly bore the name of Magadesi,
but exchanged that appellation for the honourable title
of Barbaro, or de’ Barbari, which was conferred upon it
in the twelfth century, in consequence of the valorous
exertions of Marco Magadesi, in a battle fought against
the Saracens, near Ascalon. Francesco was born at
Venice, in the year 1398. At an early age he was placed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
under the tuition of John of Ravenna, and was afterwards
entrusted to the care of Gasperino Barziza.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
Under the auspices of these instructors he made a surprisingly
rapid progress in the study of the Latin tongue. In
the acquisition of the rudiments of the Greek language he
was assisted by Guarino Veronese, and not, as some have
erroneously supposed, by Manuel Crysoloras. So suddenly
did the talents of Francesco come to maturity, that he
made a public exhibition of his acquirements in the eighteenth
year of his age, at which early period he pronounced
the funeral eulogium of Giovanni Corrodino, a physician of
Padua; and also, at the command of the directors of the
Paduan university, delivered an oration on the occasion
of the conferring the degree of doctor of civil and canon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
law on Alberto Guidalotti, a noble Perugian. But a more
singular instance of the precocity of his mind was displayed
in the course of the same year, in the publication of his
treatise <i>De Re Uxoriâ</i>, which was received by the learned
with universal applause.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> The vacancy of the pontifical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
throne still affording to the officers of the Roman chancery
a considerable degree of leisure, Poggio about this time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
undertook an expedition of no small importance to the
interests of literature. Having received information that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
many ancient manuscripts of classic authors were scattered
in various monasteries, and other repositories in the neighbourhood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
of Constance, where they were suffered to perish
in neglected obscurity, he determined to rescue these precious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
relics from the hands of barbarians, who were so little
sensible of their value. He was not deterred from this
laudable design by the inclemency of the season, or by the
ruinous state of the roads; but with an industry and perseverance,
which cannot be too highly applauded, he made
several excursions to the places which were said to contain
the objects of his research. These excursions he even extended
to the city of Paris. For the fatigue and trouble
which he encountered in these inquiries he was requited by
the most signal success. A great number of manuscripts,
some of which contained portions of classic authors, which
the admirers of ancient learning had hitherto sought for in
vain, were the reward of his literary zeal. The scholars of
Italy took a lively interest in these investigations of their
learned countryman. The noble art of printing has in modern
times rendered books so easily accessible to all ranks of
men, that we cannot enter into the feelings of those whose
libraries were scantily furnished with volumes, which were
slowly multiplied by the tedious process of transcription.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
But the epistolary correspondence of the studious of the fifteenth
century contains frequent and striking intimations of
the value which was then set upon good modern copies of the
works of classic writers. It may therefore be easily presumed,
that the discovery of an ancient manuscript was a
common subject of exultation to all the lovers of the polite
arts. In the following letter from Leonardo Aretino to Poggio,
congratulating him on the success of his expedition, and
particularly on his acquisition of a perfect copy of Quintilian’s
treatise on Oratory, the writer speaks the sentiments
of the literary characters of the age.</p>

<p>“I have seen the letter which you wrote to our friend
Niccolo, on the subject of your last journey, and the
discovery of some manuscripts. In my opinion the republic
of letters has reason to rejoice, not only on account
of the acquisition of the works which you have already
recovered, but also on account of the hope which I see you
entertain of the recovery of others. It will be your glory
to restore to the present age, by your labour and diligence,
the writings of excellent authors, which have hitherto
escaped the researches of the learned. The accomplishment
of your undertaking will confer an obligation, not on
us alone, but on the successors to our studies. The memory
of your services will never be obliterated. It will
be recorded to distant ages, that these works, the loss of
which had been for so long a period a subject of lamentation
to the friends of literature, have been recovered by
your industry. As Camillus, on account of his having
rebuilt the city of Rome, was stiled its second founder, so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
you may be justly denominated the second author of all
those pieces which are restored to the world by your meritorious
exertions. I therefore most earnestly exhort you
not to relax in your endeavours to prosecute this laudable
design. Let not the expense which you are likely to incur
discourage you from proceeding. I will take care to provide
the necessary funds. I have the pleasure of informing
you, that from this discovery of yours, we have
already derived more advantage than you seem to be
aware of; for by your exertions we are at length in possession
of a perfect copy of Quintilian. I have inspected
the titles of the books. We have now the entire treatise,
of which, before this happy discovery, we had only one
half, and that in a very mutilated state. Oh! what a
valuable acquisition! What an unexpected pleasure! Shall
I then behold Quintilian whole and entire, who, even in
his imperfect state, was so rich a source of delight? I
entreat you, my dear Poggio, send me the manuscript as
soon as possible, that I may see it before I die. As to
Asconius and Flaccus, I am glad that you have recovered
them, though neither of these authors have conferred any
additional grace on Latin literature. But Quintilian is so
consummate a master of rhetoric and oratory, that when,
after having delivered him from his long imprisonment in
the dungeons of the barbarians, you transmit him to this
country, all the nations of Italy ought to assemble to bid
him welcome. I cannot but wonder that you and your
friends did not eagerly take him in hand, and that,
employing yourselves in the transcription of inferior
writers, you should have neglected Quintilian—an author,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
whose works I will not hesitate to affirm, are more an
object of desire to the learned than any others, excepting
only Cicero’s dissertation <i>De Republicâ</i>. I must next
admonish you not to waste your time on the works which
we already possess, but to search for those which we have
not, especially the works of Cicero and Varro.”<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>Poggio was far from being unconscious of the good
service which he had done to the cause of letters, by the
successful assiduity of his researches after the lost writers of
antiquity. [A. D. 1416.] On the sixteenth of December
of this year, he wrote to Guarino Veronese an epistle, in
which, after duly extolling the importance and agreeable
nature of the intelligence which he was about to announce,
he gave him a particular account of the treasure which he
had lately brought to light. From this letter it appears,<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
that in consequence of information which Poggio had
received, that a considerable number of books were deposited
in the monastery of St. Gall, he took a journey to that
town, accompanied by some of his friends. There they
found a large number of manuscripts, and among the rest
a complete copy of Quintilian, buried in rubbish and dust.
For the books in question were not arranged in a library,
but were thrown into the lowest apartment or dungeon of a
tower, “Which,” says Poggio, “was not even a fit residence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
for a condemned criminal.” Besides Quintilian they
found in this obscure recess the three first, and one half of
the fourth books of the Argonautics of Valerius Flaccus,
and Asconius Pedianus’s comment on eight of Cicero’s
orations. The two latter manuscripts Poggio himself transcribed,
with an intention of sending them to Leonardo
Aretino, who, as appears by his letters quoted above, was
so much elated by the revival of Quintilian, that he speaks
of the discovery of Asconius and Flaccus as a matter of
comparatively trifling moment.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>Poggio zealously concurred in the wish of his friend
Leonardo, to rescue from obscurity the lost works of Cicero.
Nor were his endeavours to accomplish this valuable object
entirely unsuccessful. In a monastery of the monks of
Clugny, in the town of Langres, he found a copy of Cicero’s
Oration for Cæcina, of which he made a transcript for the
use of his Italian friends. In the course of various journeys,
which the vicissitudes of fortune obliged him to take at
different periods of his life, he had the satisfaction to
discover the following orations of the same author, the loss
of which had been long deplored by the learned—De lege
Agrariâ contra Rullum liber primus—Ejusdem liber secundus—Contra
legem Agrariam ad populum—In L. Pisonem.
A copy of these orations is preserved in the Abbey of Santa
Maria, at Florence, to which is affixed a memorandum,
which records the fact of their having been discovered by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
Poggio. This memorandum indeed makes mention of
seven orations as having been found by him in France and
Germany; and the catalogue prefixed to the manuscript,
besides the works above mentioned, enumerates the Oration
pro C. Rabirio Pisone—Pro C. Rabirio perduellionis reo—and
pro Roscio Comœdo—but these orations have been torn
from the volume in question.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> With the assistance of
Bartolomeo di Montepulciano, Poggio also restored to light
the poem of Silius Italicus—Lactantius’s treatise de irâ Dei
et opificio hominis—Vegetius de re Militari—Nonius Marcellus—Ammianus
Marcellinus<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>—Lucretius<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>—Columella
and Tertullian.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>Before the time of Poggio, eight only of the comedies
of Plautus were known to the classical student. But by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
industry or good fortune of one Nicolas of Treves, whom
Poggio employed in continuing the researches in the monasteries
of Germany, which he was unable to conduct in
person, twelve more were brought to light. When Poggio
had notice of this discovery, he was highly elated, and
strenuously exhorted the cardinal Ursini to dispatch a trusty
messenger to bring these valuable treasures to Rome. “I
was not only solicitous, but importunate with his eminence,”
says Poggio in a letter to Niccolo Niccoli, “to
send somebody for the books.” The cardinal did not however
second the impatience of the Italian literati, who waited
nearly two years before the manuscripts in question arrived
in Rome, whither they were brought by Nicolas of Treves
himself.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span></p>

<p>Besides Plautus’s comedies, Nicolas of Treves brought
to Rome a fragment of Aulus Gellius.</p>

<p>Poggio also found a copy of Julius Frontinus de
Aquæductis, and eight books of Firmicus’s treatise on the
mathematics, lying neglected and forgotten in the archives
of the monastery of Monte Cassino; and at the instance of
Niccolo Niccoli he prevailed upon the governors of that
religious house, to allow him to convey these manuscripts
to his own residence, for the purpose of decyphering and
copying them. After he had transcribed Frontinus with his
own hand, he returned the original manuscript to the library
where it had been discovered.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> He also procured at Cologne
a copy of Petronius Arbiter, a small fragment of which
author he had before discovered in Britain. By his exertions
also the entire work of Columella was brought to light, of
which only fragments had been known to the earlier scholars.
For the preservation of Calpurnius’s Bucolic also, the
republic of letters is indebted to the sagacious diligence of
Poggio.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span></p>

<p>In a long and elaborate letter which Poggio received
from Francesco Barbaro, and which bears the date of June
7th, 1417, this learned patrician congratulates his correspondent
on the glory which he had acquired by his labours
in the cause of learning, and ascribes to the unremitted
diligence of his investigations, the recovery of the works
of the following authors, in addition to others which have
been already enumerated; Manilius, Lucius Septimius,
Caper, Eutychius, and Probus. From this letter of Barbaro,
it appears, that the republic of letters had expected
that Poggio would have been materially assisted in his
inquiries after the relics of ancient literature by Bartolomeo
di Montepulciano, but that in consequence of the ill state of
his associate’s health, he was under the necessity of taking
upon himself almost the entire conduct and trouble of the
research.</p>

<p>The expense occasioned by these literary excursions was
a heavy incumbrance upon Poggio, whose property could
by no means bear any extraordinary diminution: and the
fatigue and inconvenience which he experienced in the course
of his travels in quest of manuscripts, induced him at one
time to declare to Niccolo Niccoli that he could not possibly
spend more time in this pursuit.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> This declaration was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
however nothing more than the result of a temporary dejection
of spirits. During the remainder of his life he
eagerly took advantage of every opportunity of recovering
the lost works of the writers of antiquity, many of which
he transcribed with his own hand. In several of his letters
the zeal with which he endeavoured to procure good copies
of the Latin classics is strikingly conspicuous. His inquiries
were incessantly and anxiously directed after the
ancient compositions which had not yet been rescued from
beneath the ruins of ages. In the course of his investigations,
he once entertained hopes of recovering the lost
Decads of Livy. A Swede, of the name of Nicolaus, had
solemnly assured him, that he had seen a perfect copy of
Livy’s Roman history in a monastery of Cistercian monks
in Hungary. On the receipt of this intelligence, he immediately
applied by letter to Niccolo Niccoli, not doubting
but that he could persuade Cosmo de’ Medici to dispatch
one Gherardo de’ Buris to the monastery where the manuscript
was said to be deposited. He was also in hopes that
cardinal Ursini would send a confidential agent to procure
this valuable work; but in these expectations he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
disappointed.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> The testimony of Nicolaus the Swede being
a few years afterwards corroborated by another traveller,
Poggio wrote a letter to Leonello d’Este, Marquis of
Ferrara, giving him an account of the information which
he had received, and intimating, that though the authority
upon which it rested was not of the highest nature, still it
was worthy of attention. Whether Leonello was induced
by Poggio’s letter to institute any inquiry after the manuscript
in question, cannot perhaps now be ascertained. Certain
it is, that the learned still lament the imperfect state of
the history of Livy.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>Poggio had also at one time conceived hopes of obtaining
from a German monk a copy of the works of Tacitus,
containing many portions of that historian’s writings, which
had till then lain neglected beneath the accumulated dust of
ages. These hopes were likewise frustrated. By the course
of events, however, it was afterwards proved that they were
not void of foundation: for during the pontificate of Leo. X.
an ancient manuscript containing five books of the history
of Tacitus, which had been long regarded as irrecoverably
lost, was found in Germany, and presented to that pontiff,
according to whose directions it was deposited in the Laurentian
library at Florence.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>Amongst the literary characters whose applause animated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
Poggio to persevere in his researches after the lost
writers of antiquity, a place of distinguished honour is due
to Ambrogio Traversari. This learned ecclesiastic was the
son of Bencivenni dei Traversari, and was born on the 16th
of September, 1386, in Portico, a town of Romagna. His
biographers are not agreed whether his family was poor
or rich, plebeian or noble.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> It appears however from incontestible
evidence, that soon after he had completed his
fourteenth year, he was admitted into the Camaldolese convent
<i>Degli Angioli</i>, at Florence, and that he there took
the monastic vows, on the sixth day of November, 1401.
At the time of his entrance into this religious seminary, it
was governed by Matteo di Guido, a Florentine, who, happily
for the welfare of the ecclesiastical fraternity committed
to his care, tempered the severity, and beguiled the wearisomeness
of the cloistered life, by the study of polite letters.
Kindly desirous of communicating to others the pleasure
which he himself experienced in literary pursuits, he personally
superintended the education of the youths whom puerile
enthusiasm, or parental authority, had secluded from the
world within the walls of his monastery. Under the care of
this enlightened superior, Ambrogio continued his Latin
studies, which he had commenced under the guidance of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
John of Ravenna. In the Greek language he was instructed
by Demetrius Scaranus, an eminent scholar, whom the
alarming inroads of the Turks had caused to fly from Constantinople,
and who was induced by the liberality of Matteo
to read lectures on the Grecian classics, in the cloisters of
this convent.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> As Ambrogio was actuated by the genuine
enthusiasm of literary zeal, he made a rapid progress in
knowledge. In the prosecution of his studies, indeed, he
enjoyed peculiar advantage. The retirement of the monastic
life afforded him considerable leisure. The library of his
convent was well furnished with books, and he had moreover
the free use of the copious collection of Niccolo
Niccoli, who regarded him with parental affection, and
assiduously fostered his ripening talents by the most liberal
patronage. Inspired by a profound veneration of the models
of just taste, which are to be found in the writings of antiquity,
he assiduously employed a considerable portion of his
time in multiplying the copies of the classic authors: and
his elegant transcripts of the works which Poggio had rescued
from obscurity, at once testified his love of literature,
and the high estimation in which he held the labours of his
friend.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<p>After the deposition of John XXII. Poggio still remained
at Constance, anxiously hoping that the appointment
of a successor to that ill-fated pontiff would enable
him once more to establish himself in the Roman chancery.
In the prosecution of his interests, he had great dependance
upon the support and patronage of Zabarella, cardinal of
Florence. But his expectations of preferment from this
quarter were unfortunately destroyed by the death of that
illustrious ecclesiastic. [A. D. 1417.] This event, which
occurred on the twenty-sixth of September, 1417, deprived
the council of one of its ablest members, and Poggio of a
kind and zealous friend. The obsequies of Zabarella were
celebrated with extraordinary pomp; and on this occasion,
Poggio fulfilled the last duties of friendship, by commemorating
his virtues in a funeral oration. Impressed by the
solemnity of the subject, and the dignity of his audience,
he exerted in the composition of this oration the full powers
of his eloquence and learning. After a modest exordium,
he proceeded to give a brief account of his departed friend—he
then entered into the detail of his good qualities, and
concluded by an impassioned burst of sorrow for the loss
which the lovers of union and peace had sustained; and by
an exhortation to the assembled dignitaries to pay to their
deceased brother the honours due to his virtues, and to
imitate the moral graces which they had so much admired in
his conduct.</p>

<p>Francesco Zabarella was a native of Padua. His
parents, who moved in the superior circles of society, readily
indulged his early love of literature, and procured him the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
best instructions which their city could afford. Having
finished his preparatory education, Francesco applied himself
to the study of the civil law, tempering the severity of
this pursuit by the cultivation of polite letters. When he
was arrived at years of maturity, he delivered public lectures
on the science of jurisprudence. In discharging the
duty of instruction, he gained the respect and love of his
pupils, by the variety of his knowledge and the benevolence
of his disposition. The celebrity which he acquired by
the ability with which he filled the professor’s chair,
attracted the notice of John XXII., who, without any
solicitation on his part, nominated him to the bishopric of
Florence, and afterwards raised him to the dignity of cardinal.
Stimulated by an earnest desire to put an end to
the schism, he successfully exerted his influence with the
pontiff to induce him to assent to the wishes of the emperor
of Germany, by summoning a general council; and
being deputed on the part of the pope, to confer with the
representatives of Sigismund, concerning the place where
the council should assemble, he concurred with them in
fixing, for that purpose, upon the city of Constance. He
entered with great zeal into the discussion of the various
subjects which engaged the attention of that renowned
synod. The ardour of his mind indeed hastened his end.
Engaging with uncommon warmth in a tumultuous debate,
at a time when he was languid with sickness, he found
himself so much exhausted, that making a last effort, he
declared, that the speech which he had just concluded was
his testamentary oration, and that he felt himself dying in
defence of the church. He did not long survive this exertion.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
After a short residence at the baths of Baden, which
seemed to be of service in recruiting his constitution, he
returned to renew his labours at Constance, where he soon
died, a victim to the ardour of his zeal, and to the unremitting
toil of his exertions.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>In the funeral eulogium which Poggio pronounced over
the remains of Zabarella, he asserts, that had the life of
his friend been prolonged, he would in all probability have
been invested with the pontifical purple. All orders of men
now began impatiently to demand the election of a sovereign
pontiff. [A. D. 1417.] In compliance with their
wishes, the cardinals assembled in conclave on the tenth of
November, and after the usual vehemence of dissention,
they at length agreed in the nomination of Otto Colonna,
who immediately after his election assumed the appellation
of Martin V.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>Thus was terminated the famous schism of the west.
Gregory XII. had died on the 18th of October preceding
the election of Martin:<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> and though Benedict XIII., confident
in the strength of the fortifications of Paniscola,
refused to submit to the decrees of the council, and still
assumed the style, and pretended to exercise the functions
of the pontificate, his adherents were so few, and the tide
of general opinion ran so strongly in favour of Martin V.,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
that he was henceforth regarded rather as an object of contempt
than of fear.</p>

<p>The council had given an awful admonition to heretics.
It had also, by an extraordinary exertion of authority,
effected an union of the true believers under a legitimate
head. But a most important and difficult matter
remained unaccomplished, namely, the reformation of the
church. The newly elected pontiff listened with apparent
complacence to the petitions which were from time to time
preferred to him, by the various subdivisions of the council,
beseeching him to prosecute this good work by all the means
in his power; but he contrived by studied delays so to
protract the consideration of the particular heads of reform,
that the members of the assembly, weary of their long residence
in Constance, were eager to embrace the first opportunity
of returning to their respective homes. This opportunity
was afforded them on the twenty-second day of April,
1418, on which day the pope formally dismissed the
council.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> On the sixteenth of May he left Constance, and
passing through Schaffausen, he proceeded by easy stages<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
to Geneva, where he arrived on the eleventh of June.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
At this city he kept his court for some months. Quitting
Germany on the twelfth day of September, he proceeded
to Milan, and afterwards to Mantua. Here he fixed his
residence during the remainder of the year, being prevented
from visiting his capital by the anarchy which the long
absence of legitimate authority had occasioned in the states
of the church. As a grateful return for the hospitality
with which he was received by the duke of Milan, he mediated
a peace between that prince and Pandolfo Malatesta,
who, after having taken Bergamo, had directed his
march to Brescia, and by the vigour of his operations had
caused the duke to tremble for the safety of the rest of his
dominions.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>Though it does not appear that Poggio held any office
under the new pontiff, he travelled in the suite of Martin V.
to Mantua. At this city he suddenly quitted the Roman
court with a determination to spend some time in England,
to which country he had been invited by Beaufort, bishop
of Winchester. This prelate, who is well known to all the
admirers of Shakspeare by the title of cardinal Beaufort,
was the son of the celebrated John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
and uncle to the reigning English monarch Henry V.
whose studies he had superintended during his residence at
Oxford. In the year 1397 he was elected bishop of Lincoln.
After having enjoyed this promotion for the space of eight
years, he succeeded William of Wickham in the see of
Winchester. He was a man of boundless ambition, well
versed in the crooked policy of court intrigue, and enormously
rich. In the course of a pilgrimage which he undertook
to make to Jerusalem, he visited the council of Constance,<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
where it is probable he first became acquainted with
the merits of Poggio.</p>

<p>Nothing but some suddenly conceived dissatisfaction
with his actual situation, or the prospect of considerable
emolument, could have induced Poggio to fix his residence
in Britain, a country regarded by the Italians as the remotest
corner of the globe, and as the abode of ignorance and
barbarity. He was in fact led to entertain great expectations
by the magnificent promises of the bishop of Winchester.
But when he arrived in London, he found himself doomed
to the common lot of those who depend upon the patronage
of the great. Beaufort wanted either leisure or inclination to
minister to the wants and wishes of his guest; and Poggio
began to feel all the inconveniences of straightened circumstances,
aggravated by the reflection that he was situated at so
serious a distance from his native land. His communication
with his early friends, and the companions of his youthful
years, was interrupted. He experienced the embarrassments<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
necessarily incident to those who are thrown into a new
circle of society, to the habits of which they are entirely
unaccustomed; and his mind became the prey of discontent
and anxiety. He was also much chagrined on observing the
uncultivated state of the public mind in Britain, when compared
with the enthusiastic love of elegant literature which
polished and adorned his native country.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> The period of
his arrival in England has been justly pronounced by one of
our most accurate historians, to be in a literary point of view
one of the darkest which occur in the whole series of British
annals.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Leland indeed and other writers enumerate long
lists of scholars, whom they indiscriminately grace with the
title of most learned. These champions of literature were
however nothing more than monks and astrologers, who
were regarded with superstitious admiration by an ignorant
age, but whose works are now deservedly buried in oblivion.
The occult sciences, scholastic philosophy, and the mysteries
of theology, absorbed the attention of the contemptible few
who advanced any pretensions to the cultivation of learning.
Of the principles of composition and the graces of style
they were totally ignorant—nay so imperfect was their
knowledge of the Latin tongue, that almost every sentence
of their writings is deformed by the barbarous introduction
of English words, miserably metamorphosed by a Latin
termination.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span></p>

<p>The respectable author, whose opinion of the state of
British literature in the fifteenth century has been quoted
above, ascribes the neglect of learning which disgraces this
portion of our history to the following causes.—The wars
in which the English had been so long engaged against
France—The schism of the west—The little encouragement
afforded to learned men—and the scarcity of books.</p>

<p>With respect to the first of these causes, it may be
observed, that a state of warfare by no means in itself precludes
the extension of science, and the cultivation of letters.
The most renowned luminaries of Greece flourished during
the devastation of the Peloponnesian war. Julius Cæsar
and Cicero were not diverted from their literary pursuits by
the tumult of faction, and the din of arms. And at the
time when literature was revived in Italy, the provinces of
that country were frequently laid waste by hostile invasions,
and its cities were agitated by the discord of contending
parties. As to the second cause, namely, the distraction
occasioned by the schism, it may be remarked, that though
this distraction was felt to a superior degree in Italy, it did
not in that country operate as the slightest check to the progress
of learning.—The want of encouragement to learned
men, is rather a consequence than a cause of the forlorn
state of literature. Some degree of knowledge and taste is
requisite to form the character of a patron of the studious.</p>

<p>The neglect of the liberal arts which spread the gloom
of barbarism over our ancestors of the fifteenth century,
may perhaps be more justly ascribed to the operation of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
feudal system. This primary cause prevented that excitation
of the public mind, which is necessary to the successful
cultivation of literature. The feudal system was a system
of strict subordination, which prescribed to every member of
the political community his particular rank and place, and
surrounded him by a circle, beyond which he was forbidden
to pass. In the spirit of this system, till the reign of
Henry IV., no farmer or mechanic was permitted to send his
children to school; and long after that period, a license
from his lord was necessary to enable a man of this description
to educate a son for the church. Whilst the majority
of the people were thus impeded in their approach to the
fountains of knowledge, it was impossible for learning to
raise her drooping head. The feudal superiors, exalted by
the accident of their birth to the enjoyment of power and
plenty, had no motive to induce them to submit to the
labour of study. The younger branches of noble families
were early taught to depend upon their swords for subsistence;
and the acquisition of learning was an object far
beyond the scope of the oppressed and humble vassal.</p>

<p>The influence of the feudal system in checking the
progress of intellect will be more plainly visible, if we consider
the circumstances of Italy during the period in question.
In that country, the ambition of adventurers, and
the extension of commerce, had broken the fetters of feudalism;
and had enabled the bold and daring in every species
of exertion to rise to the pitch of consequence which their
talents could vindicate. Hence the dormant powers of the
human mind were roused, and the expansion of learning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
and the liberal arts was promoted. The equalizing tyranny
of the petty princes who usurped the sovereignty of various
cities of Lombardy, whilst it repressed the power of the
aristocracy, called into life the abilities of all the orders
of society. The precarious title by which these chieftains
held their exalted stations induced them to court popularity,
by freeing the mass of the people from invidious restraints.
During the residence of the popes at Avignon, and during
the continuance of the schism, the feeble rule exercised by
the pontifical deputies over the ecclesiastical cities enabled
the inhabitants of those cities to defy the authority which
endeavoured to confine their exertions within the limits of
slavish subordination. The factions which disturbed the
peace of the Italian republics tended also in an eminent
degree to call forth the full energy of abilities, which in
other circumstances would have been buried in obscurity.
Great talents are too frequently united with turbulence of
spirit. In times when the order of society is inverted by
the tumults of civil broils, while men of peaceful souls
retire trembling from the conflict, he who is endued with
the energy of genius, comes forth, conscious of his strength,
and despising every danger, exults in the hope of vindicating
his claim to promotion.</p>

<p>It is evident, that these various stimulants of intellect
which occurred in Italy did not occur in Britain. On this
account, whilst the liberal arts were cultivated and respected
in the former country, they were neglected and despised in
the latter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span></p>

<p>Another cause of incitement to the study of letters,
which operated in Italy, and was wanting in Britain, arose
from the subdivision of the former country into a variety
of petty states. These states maintained a constant intercourse
with each other, by the medium of ambassadors,
who were usually selected from among the most distinguished
candidates for literary fame. Thus one of the most honourable
offices in the civil department of the state was presented
to inflame the ambition of the studious, and the
diplomatic profession became the nurse of learning.</p>

<p>When the wish of acquiring knowledge was excited,
the numerous copies of the works of the ancients, which
were scattered throughout Italy, afforded ample means of
instruction; while the penury of Britain in this respect
repressed the exertions of inquiry, and excluded the nascent
scholar from the cultivated regions of classic taste.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>The vexation which Poggio experienced, when he
contemplated the gloomy contrast which Britain exhibited,
when compared with his native land, was encreased by the
receipt of letters from Italy, informing him, that whilst he
was wasting his days in the unprofitable pursuit of preferment,
his late associates were enjoying, with scholastic
rapture, the perusal of some valuable manuscripts, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
had been discovered at Lodi by Gerardo Landriani, bishop
of that city. This prelate had rescued from a heap of
rubbish a very ancient copy of various works of Cicero,
written in a character so antique, that few were able to
decypher it. The manuscript in question contained, besides
Cicero’s treatise on Rhetoric, which was already in the hands
of collectors of books, the following works of the same elegant
writer, which had till this period escaped the researches of
the learned—The three books De Oratore, entire—Brutus
de claris Oratoribus—and the Orator ad Brutum. Nobody
could be found at Milan who was able to read the character
in which these treatises were written. But Cosmo of Cremona,
a scholar of excellent accomplishments, decyphered
and copied the treatise De Oratore; and the celebrated
Flavio Biondo<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> undertook and soon accomplished the task<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
of transcribing Brutus de claris Oratoribus. From these
transcripts copies were speedily multiplied, and dispersed all
over Italy, while Poggio was waiting with the utmost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
impatience, till Leonardo Aretino could convey one of these
copies to the distant region in which his friend then resided.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>At this inauspicious period, Poggio was filled with
anxiety on account of the destitute condition of his mother,
and also by the dissolute conduct of one of his brothers.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
In these circumstances his uneasiness and vexation were
greatly aggravated by the receipt of a letter from Niccolo
Niccoli, containing grievous complaints against Leonardo
Aretino, and informing him, that the bond of friendship,
by which his correspondent and Leonardo had for so long a
space of time been united, was for ever sundered.</p>

<p>The quarrel which took place between Leonardo
Aretino and Niccolo Niccoli, originated in a cause, which
has, in every age, been productive of the fiercest and most
fatal contentions, namely, the uncontrolled gratification of
the passion, or rather of the appetite, of love. The following
are the principal circumstances which gave rise to this
unfortunate disagreement. Giovanni, the younger brother
of Niccolo, kept a mistress of the name of Benvenuta. As
the two brothers resided in the same house, Niccolo had frequent
opportunities of seeing this syren, whose charms and
allurements gained such an ascendancy over his better principles,
that after having for some time carried on an intrigue
with her in private, he at length, in defiance of all decency,
openly robbed his brother of his fair companion, and established<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
Benvenuta in his own apartments.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> It may easily be
imagined, that Giovanni did not tamely submit to such an
injury. In consequence of his resentment, the neighbourhood
was daily disturbed by the outrages of fraternal discord.
One of the worst effects produced by such disgraceful connections
as that which Niccolo had formed with Benvenuta, is
the absolute ascendancy which artful and wicked women
thereby gain over men of weak minds; and which they uniformly
exercise, in setting their lovers at variance with their
relations and friends. The history of Niccolo confirms the
truth of this observation. By the crafty insinuations of his
mistress his affections were alienated from those with whom he
had formerly been united by the bonds of consanguinity and
friendship. Influenced by her suggestions, he dropped all
intercourse with his five brothers, and quarrelled with Lorenzo
de’ Medici, whom he had till this unfortunate transaction
been proud to enumerate amongst his dearest associates. In
the height of her insolence, Benvenuta had the audacity to
defame the character of the wife of Jacopo, one of the
brothers of Niccolo. Jacopo, for some time, endured her
insolence with patient contempt; but at length exasperated
by her petulance, he asked the advice, and demanded the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
assistance of his brothers. They sympathized with him
in his resentment, and readily gave him the aid which he
required. Proceeding to the house of Niccolo, they seized
the termagant beauty, and exalting her on the back of one
of their attendants, to the great amusement of the by-standers,
they inflicted on her a species of chastisement, in
the administration of which convenience and severity are
consulted much more than modesty. Niccolo was a helpless
witness of the pain and disgrace suffered by Benvenuta.
This spectacle had such an effect on his feelings, that,
vowing vengeance against his brothers, he retired to his
house, and delivered himself up to the most immoderate
transports of grief. Hearing that he was thus afflicted,
several of his acquaintance paid him visits of condolence,
from which they returned, ridiculing his folly, and fully
persuaded that his anger had impaired his reason. In this
conjuncture, Leonardo Aretino, being aware that Niccolo
was not in a mood to listen with patience to the remonstrances
which he thought it his duty to make to him on
the extravagance of his conduct, cautiously avoided going
to his house. This circumstance did not escape the observation
of the mourner, who sent word to Leonardo, that
he was surprised that he had not received from him the
common offices of friendly consolation. To this message
Leonardo replied, that he was surprised that Niccolo should
expect consolation from his friends on so trifling a subject
of sorrow as the chastisement of his cook-maid; and that
he thought it was time for him to put an end to his folly.
This message added fuel to the flame of Niccolo’s wrath.
He now kept no measures with Leonardo; but abjured his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
friendship, and eagerly embraced every opportunity of inveighing
against him with the utmost bitterness.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> Leonardo
did not submit with patience to the angry maledictions
of his former associate. In a bitter invective which he published
against Niccolo, under the designation of <i>Nebulo
Maleficus</i>, he returned railing for railing; and, notwithstanding
the mediation of their common acquaintance, and,
amongst the rest of Poggio, the breach of friendship which
had been thus unhappily occasioned by the intemperate
passions of Niccolo, daily became wider.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>Whilst the feelings of Poggio were thus wounded by
the dissension of his dearest friends, he earnestly solicited
from his patron some recompense for the long journey
which he had undertaken, at his invitation, and in reliance
on his promises of preferment and support. His
solicitations were for a long time entirely fruitless. He
found, by mortifying experience, that men of exalted rank
are much more ready to make promises than to fulfil their
engagements. “At length,” to adopt his own expression,
“the mountain laboured, and produced a mouse.” The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
wealthy and powerful Bishop of Winchester presented his
client with a benefice, the annual income of which was
nominally one hundred and twenty florins; but in consequence
of various deductions, its revenues did not in fact
amount even to that inconsiderable sum. Poggio had
always entertained great objections to the clerical life. His
objections were not founded upon a contempt of the institutions
of religion. On the contrary, they proceeded from
the exalted idea which he entertained of the duties of the
clerical office. Sensible, as he himself says in a letter to
Niccolo Niccoli, of the serious charge which they impose
upon themselves, who undertake the cure of souls, he was
diffident of his qualifications to execute the duties of an
office, the faithful discharge of which demanded the most
indefatigable industry, and the most scrupulous correctness
of moral conduct.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> Influenced by these considerations,
which certainly bear very satisfactory testimony to the purity
of his principles, though he was soon promoted to a much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
richer living, he wished to exchange it for a benefice without
cure of souls. To meet his wishes in this respect a canonicate
was offered him; but it is uncertain whether this arrangement
was perfected.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> However this may be, he was weary of
his residence in England, and impatiently longed to return
to his native land. At this juncture, he received from Italy
two proposals, the one on the part of Alamano Adimaro,
Archbishop of Pisa and Cardinal of St. Eusebius, who
invited him to accept the office of Secretary to the Roman
pontiff; the other from Piero Lamberteschi, who offered
him a situation, the nature of which is not precisely
known, but which was probably that of public professor in
one of the Italian universities. Poggio seems to have
received the proposal of Lamberteschi with considerable
satisfaction. On this subject he thus expresses himself in
a letter to Niccolo Niccoli.</p>

<p>“The day before yesterday, I received two letters
from you, and one from Piero Lamberteschi. These
letters I have read with great attention. I am pleased
with Piero’s plan, and I think I shall follow your advice.
He says, that he will do his endeavour to procure me
five hundred gold florins for three years’ services. Make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
them six hundred, and I will agree to the proposal. He
lays before me flattering hopes of future profitable contingencies,
and I am inclined to believe, that these hopes
may probably be realized: yet I think it more prudent
to covenant for something, than to depend upon hope
alone. I like the employment to which he invites me,
and I hope I shall produce something worth reading;
but for this purpose, as I have informed him, I must be
indulged with leisure and retirement.”</p>

<p>The invitation of the cardinal of St. Eusebius was not
so satisfactory to the wishes of Poggio. In the letter from
which the foregoing extracts have been made, he thus
expresses himself.</p>

<p>“I observe what the cardinal writes on the subject of
the secretaryship. If I had valued that office as highly
as some do, I should long ago have returned to Rome.
I have less esteem for the pontificate and its members,
than they imagine; for I wish to be a free man, and not
a public slave. Ratify the offers of Piero, and you shall
see that I shall avoid the Roman court with more diligence
than many people would be apt to believe. I
must earnestly request that you will not communicate
my plans to any one, since we are ignorant of what may
happen—for man proposes, but God directs the issues
of things.”<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span></p>

<p>The event of these negociations demonstrated the
prudence of Poggio, in not precipitately rejecting the
invitation of Adimaro. Some obstacle intervened to prevent
the execution of the plan proposed by Lamberteschi;
and we may estimate the impatience with which Poggio
endured his exile from Italy, by the undoubted fact, that
notwithstanding the above confession of his dislike of the
pontifical court, he accepted the office of Secretary to
Martin V. He accordingly quitted England, where his
hopes had been so severely disappointed, and after a journey,
of the incidents of which no record appears in his
works, he once more took up his residence at Rome.</p>

<p>It is very probable, that Poggio communicated to
his Italian correspondents an account of the remarkable
circumstances which he observed in the course of his journey
to England, and of his return to his native land. It
is also reasonable to suppose, that some of the letters which
he wrote from this country would contain his opinion of
the manners and customs of our ancestors. If this was the
case, we have reason to lament that these interesting documents
are not yet made public. Though incidental mention
is frequently made in the works of Poggio, of his
residence in Britain, he never dwells upon this topic. A
trait of the manners of the English in the fifteenth century
occurs in his dialogue on Nobility, in which he thus notices
the English aristocracy.—“The nobles of England deem it
disgraceful to reside in cities, and prefer living in retirement
in the country. They estimate the degree of a
man’s nobility by the extent of his estates. Their time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
is occupied in agricultural pursuits, and they trade in wool
and sheep, not thinking it at all derogatory to their dignity
to be engaged in the sale of the produce of their
lands. I have known a wealthy merchant, who had
closed his mercantile concerns, vested his money in land,
and retired into the country, become the founder of a
noble race; and I have seen him freely admitted into
the society of the most illustrious families. Many persons
also of ignoble blood have been advanced to the
honours of nobility by the favour of their sovereign,
which they have merited by their warlike achievements.”<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>In his <i>Historia Disceptativa Convivialis</i>, he relates
another trait of the manners of our forefathers, which he
records as an instance of their politeness. A splenetic
traveller would probably have quoted it as a proof of their
love of good living. “The English,” says he, “if they
meet with any one at whose table they have dined, even if
the rencounter should take place ten days after the feast,
thank him for his good entertainment; and they never
omit this ceremony, lest they should be thought insensible
of his kindness.”<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>From the following story, which Poggio has chronicled
in his <i>Facetiæ</i>, we learn, that at this early period the
English were addicted to the practice of diverting themselves
at the expense of their brethren on the other side of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
St. George’s channel, and that when he visited this country,
an Irishman was already become the common hero of an
English tale of absurdity.</p>

<p>“When I was in England, I heard a curious anecdote
of an Irish captain of a ship. In the midst of a violent
storm, when all hands had given themselves over for lost,
he made a vow, that if his ship should be saved from
the imminent danger which threatened to overwhelm her,
he would make an offering at the church of the Virgin
Mary of a waxen taper, as large as the main-mast. One
of the crew observing that it would be impossible to
discharge this vow, since all the wax in England would
not be sufficient to make such a taper,—hold your
tongue, said the captain, and do not trouble yourself
with calculating whether I can perform my promise or
not, provided we can escape the present peril.”<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>Whilst Poggio was living in a kind of exile in England,
the sovereign pontiff was in a manner banished from
his capital. On his arrival in Italy, Martin V. found the
states of the church in the hands of troops of banditti,
who had taken advantage of the disorders of the times, to
spread ruin and devastation through every quarter of the
pontifical dominions. The passes, and places of strength,
were so generally occupied by these adventurers, who were
in the pay of a noted chieftain, named Braccio di Montone,
that the pontiff did not dare to expose himself to their
outrages, by attempting to establish himself in Rome.
The inhabitants of Bologna also, espousing the cause of
John XXII., had shut their gates against him. He was
therefore reduced to the necessity of taking refuge in some
friendly territory. In this extremity, the Florentines
offered him an asylum, and Martin accordingly removed his
court from Mantua to their city, into which he made his
public entry with extraordinary pomp, on the twenty-sixth
of February, 1419.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> His residence in Florence did not,
however, produce within his mind any friendly sentiments
towards his hosts. The Florentines indeed, by their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
behaviour to their illustrious guest, greatly diminished the
value of the favour which they had conferred upon him,
in affording him a place of rest. At this period, they were
elated with the self-confidence occasioned by a long series
of almost uninterrupted prosperity. Filippo, who upon
the death of his brother, Giovanni Maria, had succeeded
to the ducal throne of Milan, disclaiming the hostile views
of his predecessors, had lived in a state of friendship with
his Tuscan neighbours, and did not even interpose to prevent
them from reducing the district of Pisa under their
dominion. In the year 1408 the repose of the Florentines
had been disturbed by an invasion of their territories by
Ladislaus, king of Naples, who had taken possession of a
considerable portion of the ecclesiastical states; but with
the assistance of Louis of Anjou, they had discomfited the
usurper, and had expelled him from the dominions of the
church. By his death, which happened in the year 1414,
they had been freed from all fear of hostile incursions, and
for the space of five years from that event, they had
enjoyed the blessing of peace. During this period they
had extended their commerce, and greatly encreased their
opulence and power. In the insolence of their pride, they
looked upon the wandering pontiff with contempt. Insensible
to those delicate impulses which prompt man to regard
the unfortunate with respect, they wantonly published the
sentiments of their hearts; and Martin was irritated and
disgusted by hearing his name made the subject of ridicule,
and the burden of contumelious songs.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> The Florentine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
populace were betrayed into these violations of decorum
by their attachment to the interests of Braccio di Montone;
and this undisguised partiality to his enemy exasperated
the indignation of the pontiff. Yielding, however, to the
pressure of circumstances, he was persuaded, by the solicitations
of the Florentine government, to agree to terms of
pacification with Braccio, whom he invested, in quality of
Vicar of the church, with the government of the cities of
Perugia, Assisi, Jesi, and Todi; in return for which condescension,
the rebellious chieftain gave up to the pontiff
the towns of Narni, Terni, Orvieto, and Orta.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> Braccio
being thus reconciled to the head of the church, and being
encouraged by the promise of an ample recompense for his
services, turned his arms against his late brethren in rebellion;
and reduced the Bolognese to submission to the
Roman see.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>During these transactions, Cosmo de’ Medici, who
had been united by the strictest ties of friendship to Baldassare
Cossa, the deposed pontiff, was very urgent in
his petitions to Martin V. to liberate his unfortunate predecessor
from confinement. Martin at length graciously
assented to Cosmo’s request; and despatched the necessary
orders to Heidleberg. But the impatience of Baldassare,
who was weary of seclusion from the world, had already
stimulated him to purchase his freedom from the Count<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
Palatine, (to whose custody he had been assigned) at the
price of thirty thousand pieces of gold. Having thus
obtained his liberty, he crossed the Alps, and arrived
safely in Italy. The well-known turbulence of his spirit
led many to expect that he would reclaim the pontifical
honours, and distract the Christian church by a renewal of
the schism. But to the surprise of every body, he repaired
with all convenient speed to Florence, where he
arrived on the 13th of May, 1419, and there, kissing the
feet of Martin, he acknowledged him as the only true and
legitimate successor of St. Peter. The spectators of this
extraordinary scene were melted into tears, and the compassion
and generosity of the pontiff were excited by this unexpected
act of submission. Deeply affected by the serious
instance of the instability of human greatness, which was thus
presented before his eyes, Martin received his humble predecessor
with kindness; and endeavoured to alleviate his sense
of the degradation which he had experienced, by creating him
cardinal, and bishop of Toscolano. The haughty spirit of
Baldassare did not long undergo the mortification of witnessing
the pomp and splendour of which he had been so
rudely deprived. He died at Florence, on the twenty-second
day of December, and was interred with much
pomp in the church of St. John. Cosmo de’ Medici
erected to his honour a magnificent monument, on which
he caused to be engraven the following simple inscription:
<span class="allsmcap">BALTHASSARIS COSSÆ IOHANNIS XXII. QUONDAM PAPÆ
CORPUS HOC TUMULO CONDITUM</span>.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> Platina asserts in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
Lives of the Popes, that Baldassare, at the time of his
death was possessed of immense treasures, which were
inherited or seized by the family of the Medici; and in
this assertion he has been copied by subsequent writers.
But Muratori maintains, on the contrary, that it is clearly
proved by his last will, that the deposed pontiff died poor
rather than rich.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span></p>

<p>The territories of the church being restored to peace
by the active exertions of Braccio di Montone, and no
obstacle remaining to prevent the pontiff from visiting his
capital, he departed from Florence and proceeded to
Rome, to which city he was welcomed by the enthusiastic
joy of the populace, on the twenty-second of September,
1420.</p>

<p>The Pontifical household being once more regularly
established in the capital of the church, Poggio, as it has
been before observed, was induced, by the invitation of
the cardinal of St. Eusebius, to accept the office of Secretary.
The time of his arrival in Rome may be fixed sometime
in the spring of 1423,<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> and it appears that his first
care, after his re-establishment in the sacred chancery, was
to renew with his friends the personal and epistolary communication,
which his long absence from Italy had interrupted.
The unfortunate quarrel of Leonardo Aretino and
Niccolo Niccoli also engaged his early attention. Nothing
is more painful to a man of an ingenuous mind, than the
occurrence of dissension between those for whom he entertains
an equal degree of friendly regard. Poggio, therefore,
embraced the first opportunity which presented itself,
of exerting his utmost endeavours to effect a reconciliation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
between the angry disputants. A long letter, which Leonardo
had dispatched to him during his residence in London,
with the view of giving him a full account of the cause of
this disgraceful strife, had never reached him; but soon
after his arrival at Rome, Leonardo supplied this deficiency
by sending him a copy of this letter, which he had kept
for the inspection of his other friends.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Poggio soon found,
that in his endeavours to terminate this unhappy difference,
he was likely to experience as serious obstacles in the
wounded pride of Leonardo, as in the infatuated wrath of
Niccolo.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> In this difficult affair, therefore, he thought
it advisable to avail himself of the assistance of the common
friends of both parties. Ambrogio Traversari had already,
indeed, interposed his good offices to bring about the
desired reconciliation, but without effect.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Poggio however
conceived great hopes, that the mediation of Francesco
Barbaro, for whom Leonardo entertained a high degree of
respect, would have considerable weight; and when that
eminent scholar, being vested with the office of ambassador
extraordinary of the Venetian Republic, paid a visit to
Rome,<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> where he was met by Leonardo, he flattered himself
that the reconciliation which he so ardently wished
would be effected. Francesco was equally desirous with
Poggio to discharge the duties of a peace-maker; but he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
found Leonardo so determined upon requiring from his antagonist
a very ample apology for his conduct, that he was
almost induced to give up the cause in despair: and Leonardo,
being perhaps apprehensive that at the time of his
departure from Rome his friends would renew their efforts
to shake his resolution, withdrew from the city in so sudden
and secret a manner, that Poggio had not an opportunity
of taking leave of him. For this conduct the latter gently
reproved his friend in a letter, in which he stated to him
his opinion, that in his affair with Niccolo, it was by no
means advisable to use recrimination, or to demand an
apology, and that nothing was requisite but a mutual
oblivion of the past. “Remember,” says he, “that it is
the characteristic of a great mind, to forget and not to
revenge injuries, and that the duties of friendship are
paramount to all other considerations. You seem to me
to attach too much importance to trifles, which it will be
more conducive to your glory to despise, than to make
them the subjects of serious concern.”<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> In a second
letter on the same subject he informed Leonardo, that he
could not, without the utmost vexation, witness the interruption
of a friendship which had been established on the
best foundation of mutual esteem, and which had continued
for so long a period; and that his concern was much
increased, when he observed that their disagreement was
detrimental to the good fame of both parties.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> In this
letter he grants, that Niccolo has his failings, but reminds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
his correspondent, that imperfection is the common lot of
mortality, and that it is our duty, according to the instructions
of the apostle, to bear one another’s burdens.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>The obstinacy of Leonardo for some time withstood
the solicitations of his friends. But Francesco Barbaro,
proceeding from Rome to Florence, laboured with such
earnestness and prudence to allay the heat of his resentment,
that he at length consented once more to enrol Niccolo
in the number of his friends. The news of this event
drew from Poggio a letter of thanks and congratulation to
the mediator, and the following prudent and friendly
admonition to Leonardo.</p>

<p>“I have just received intelligence of an event, the
most delightful which could possibly have occurred at
the present time; namely, the reconciliation which has
taken place between you and Niccolo. This circumstance
inspires me with the greatest pleasure, especially because
it proves that you do not belie the promise of your
former years; but that you support the consistency of
your excellent character. It must now be your care to
act with such prudence, that this reconciliation may be
improved into a renewal of friendship. It is not enough
that your hatred is at an end. Love and kind affection
must succeed in the place of animosity. These are the
indications of an upright, ingenuous, and virtuous mind.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
Reassume then I beseech you, that familiar and friendly
intercourse with Niccolo, which I have for so long a space
of time witnessed with so much pleasure. Carefully
avoid every thing which may tend to impair your mutual
good will; and act in such a manner that this reconciliation
may appear to have been effected, not merely by
the interposition of your friends, but by your own free
will, and with your hearty concurrence. By your conduct
you have obtained the greatest glory, and I trust you
will find it the source of the most exquisite pleasure. I
can assure you that this event has given the utmost satisfaction
to all our friends at Rome—I say <i>our</i> friends;
for I have the happiness of being connected by the bonds
of friendship with all your associates in the pontifical
court. The reputation which you have acquired by your
conduct in this affair, you must support by perseverance
and firmness of mind; for your late enmity would soon
have injured the reputation both of yourself and of Niccolo.
By your reconciliation however you have maintained
your dignity, and conciliated the esteem of the
virtuous and the learned. I have written a short letter
to Niccolo, and am anxious to receive his answer; for I
am surprised that neither you nor he should have given
me the least intimation of this event; especially when
you were both fully sensible how much I was interested
in it.”<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>In the thirty-ninth session of the council of Constance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
it had been decreed, that for the suppression and prevention
of heresy and schism, at the end of five years after the
dissolution of the existing council, another should be summoned;
a third at the expiration of seven years from the
breaking up of the second; and that after these extraordinary
meetings, general councils should be regularly held
once in every ten years. At the expiration of the prescribed
term, therefore, Martin V. according to the tenor of the
first head of this decree, summoned the representatives of
the different nations of Christendom to repair to Pavia.
[A. D. 1423.] Nothing however having lately occurred,
particularly to interest the Christian powers in the proceedings
of the Roman hierarchy, the inconsiderable numbers
of this assembly formed a striking contrast with the multitudes
who had a few years before this time flocked on a
similar occasion to the city of Constance. The plague
having made its appearance in Pavia, the council was
removed to Siena, where it began to be more numerously
frequented. Alfonso, king of Arragon, took this opportunity
of supporting, in opposition to Martin V., the pretensions
of Piero da Luna, who still assumed the name of
Benedict XIII. and maintained a sort of pontifical splendour
in the fortress of Paniscola. Alfonso was prompted thus
to trouble the peace of the church, by the resentment
which he felt against Martin, in consequence of that pontiff’s
refusing to acknowledge the legitimacy of his pretensions to
the throne of Naples. On the death of Ladislaus, the
crown of that distracted realm was inherited by his sister,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
Johanna II.,<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> who soon after her accession married Jacques,
count of La Marche, a prince of the royal blood of France.
The ambition of Jacques, who, not contented with administering
the government in the name of his wife, wished to
be acknowledged as sovereign paramount of the kingdom,
occasioned serious disputes between him and Joanna, which
terminated in his being obliged to quit the territories of
Naples, and flee to France. Soon after his arrival in that
country he renounced the pursuit of secular concerns, and
assumed the habit of the Franciscan order. In this conjuncture,
Louis III. of Anjou revived the claims of his house
upon the throne of Naples, and marched into Italy, at the
head of a considerable army, with the intention of prosecuting
his rights by the sword.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> Seeing the necessity of opposing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
against this invader an adversary of distinguished
abilities, Joanna adopted as her son, Alfonso, king of
Arragon, a prince of great courage and military skill, by
whose active exertions, Louis of Anjou was soon driven
from the Neapolitan territories. The adopted son of Joanna
being unfortunately influenced by the views of her late
husband, and wishing to rule by his own sole authority, that
princess was justly disgusted by his ingratitude, and in the
year 1423, she annulled the act of his adoption, substituting
in his place his rival, the duke of Anjou. This circumstance
gave rise to an obstinate war between the two parties,
in the commencement of which Martin entered into an
alliance with Louis, and by bestowing on him the investiture
of the kingdom of Naples, supported his claims, in
opposition to those of Alfonso. Prompted by the spirit
of revenge, the Arragonese monarch exerted all his influence
to raise a party against Martin in the council of Siena. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
pontiff, alarmed by the intrigues of Alfonso, hastily dissolved
that assembly early in the year 1424, summoning
another to meet at the end of seven years, in the city of
Basil.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>But the dissolution of the council did not shelter Martin
from the consequences of Alfonso’s indignation. Braccio
di Montone, taking advantage of the embarrassments of the
pontiff, again invaded the states of the church; and after
making himself master of several towns in the ecclesiastical
district, laid siege to Aquila. Alarmed by the loss of these
places, and apprehensive, that should Braccio make himself
master of Aquila, he would in fact keep Rome itself
in a state of blockade, the pontiff applied for succour to
Joanna of Naples, and by the assistance of that princess
raised a considerable body of forces, which he sent to stop
the career of the invader. In this expedition the army of
the church was signally successful. Braccio quitting a most
advantageous position, advanced to give battle to the pontifical
troops in the open field, on the second day of June,
1424. The encounter of his cavalry was fierce and impetuous;
but in consequence of his rashness, his army was
defeated, and Braccio himself, being mortally wounded,
was carried prisoner into Aquila, where he died in the
course of a few hours after his arrival. His body was
conveyed to Rome, and buried without the walls in unconsecrated
ground. By the death of Braccio, the pontiff<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
recovered Perugia, Assisi, and the other cities, which the
successful rebellion of that chieftain had compelled him to
yield to his dominion. The states of the church were now
restored to tranquillity. The roads were cleared of the
banditti by which they had been so long infested—the
traveller journeyed without molestation or fear—the laws
were respected, and peace and order succeeded to anarchy
and rapine.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> The quiet of the church was also further
secured by the death of Benedict XIII., who in the beginning
of this year closed his earthly career at Paniscola, at
the advanced age of ninety.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> In the summer of this year,
the Pontiff having retired to Tivoli to avoid the plague,
which was raging in Rome, Poggio went to Rieti, where
he remained two months, entirely occupied with literary
pursuits. This appears from a letter addressed by him to
Niccolo Niccoli after his return to Rome, in which he
laments the loss of a brother on whom he had depended
as the support of his family, and especially of his mother,
who was then labouring under the evils of old age and
sickness.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>About this time Martin had an opportunity of gratifying
the animosity which he entertained against the Florentines,
by secretly fomenting certain disputes which had
taken place between the administrators of their republic and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
the duke of Milan. Encouraged by the connivance of the
pontiff, that prince declared war against the Tuscan state,
the territories of which he menaced with a considerable
army. In the course of this contest, which was singularly
obstinate and bloody, the pontiff had the satisfaction of
retaining in his own hands the balance of power; and of
beholding the supercilious Tuscans, humbled by disasters
and defeats, suing to him for assistance, and entreating his
mediation for the restoration of peace. Martin, though he
professed the strictest impartiality between the hostile
parties, not only refused to assist the Florentines, but still
continued secretly to stimulate the ambition of their adversary.
Being thus disappointed in their application to the
pontiff, the Florentines had recourse to the Venetians,
whose dread of the growing power of the duke of Milan
induced them readily to enter into an alliance with his
antagonists. Animated by this accession of strength, the
Florentines prosecuted the war with renewed vigour, and
with such success, that the duke was glad to accept of the
mediation opportunely proffered by his friend the pontiff,
under whose auspices a peace was concluded at Ferrara in
the year 1428.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span></p>

<p>When the pontiff had declared his readiness to interpose
his good offices between the contending powers, for
the restoration of peace, the Florentines sent Leonardo
Aretino to the Roman court, invested with the dignity of
embassador of the Tuscan republic.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> In the nomination
of their representative, they gratified the wishes of Martin V.
who had long entertained a great respect for Leonardo,
and had in vain attempted, by the offer of considerable
preferment, to induce him to enter into his service.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> So
highly did Leonardo’s constituents approve of his conduct
in his diplomatic capacity, that immediately after his return
to Florence, in the latter end of the year 1427, they
appointed him to fill the honourable and lucrative office of
Secretary or Vice-chancellor of the Florentine state. If
credit may be given to his own assertion in a letter to
Feltrino Boiardo, he accepted this dignity with reluctance,
and lamented the imperious necessity, which compelled him,
from a sense of duty, to relinquish the pleasures of literary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
retirement, for the cares incident to a public station.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> His
reluctance is, however, otherwise accounted for in an epistle
which Poggio wrote to him on this occasion, and from
which it appears, that when the office in question was first
offered to his acceptance, it was proposed that the marks of
dignity usually attached to it should be withdrawn; but
that on his refusal to accept it on those conditions, the
administrators of the government agreed to confer upon
him the full honours which had been received by preceding
Vice-chancellors, to which terms he acceded. When Poggio
was informed that his friend was established in his new
office, he congratulated him by letter on this accession to
his civic honours, which, however, he observed, was, like
matrimony, likely to be attended with considerable difficulty,
trouble, and uneasiness.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>The satisfaction which Martin V. experienced in witnessing
the peaceful and happy condition of that portion of
Christendom, the civil interests of which were intrusted to
his immediate care, was not a little lessened by the contumacy
and rebellion of the Bohemian reformers. These
high-spirited men had been fired with indignation, when
they were informed of the sad catastrophe of their beloved
apostles, John Huss, and Jerome of Prague. The censures<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
of the church, which were fulminated against their
opinions, they treated with contempt. Taking advantage
of the weakness of Winceslaus, their king, they possessed
themselves of several churches in Prague and its environs,
where they caused the communion to be administered in
both kinds, and openly defied the pope, the emperor, and
the council of Constance. Upon the death of Winceslaus,
their confidence in their strength, and the ardour of their
zeal, impelled them to risk a contest with the power of
Sigismund, his successor. Led on by the intrepid Zisca,
they encountered danger without fear; and in the shock of
battle, their impetuosity was irresistible. For the space of
four years, the military talents of their favourite commander
discomfited the armies of the emperor, who was at length
reduced to the mortifying necessity of entering into a treaty
with a man, whom he could regard in no other light than
as an obstinate infidel, and a rebellious subject. This
treaty was interrupted by the death of Zisca, who was cut
off by the plague, on the sixth of October, 1424, at
the castle of Priscow. After the death of this formidable
antagonist, Sigismund, in hopes that the courage of the
Bohemians would expire with their chieftain, again appealed
to arms. But he was disappointed in his expectation.
Great occasions produce great men. The heretics chose
as the successor to Zisca, Procopius, an officer whose
valour and skill they had frequently seen put to the proof.
Procopius maintained the contest with courage, conduct,
and success, and worsted the imperial forces in various
engagements. The intelligence of these continued disasters
filled the mind of the pontiff with vexation. Resolving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
to aid the emperor with the temporal and spiritual
power of the church, he proclaimed a crusade against the
heretics, and sent a commission to cardinal Beaufort,
authorizing him, in quality of legate, to wield the sword
of the church, and chastise her rebellious sons. This
commission was by no means disagreeable to the turbulent
spirit of Beaufort. In pursuance of the instructions which
he received from the pontiff, he appropriated to the purposes
of the crusade, a tenth part of the revenues which
accrued from England to the Roman see.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> With this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
money he raised an army of four thousand men, at the
head of which he encamped in the neighbourhood of Dover,
waiting for a favourable wind to pass over to Flanders.
[A. D. 1429.] Here he received letters from the duke
of Gloucester, regent of the kingdom, requesting him to
transport his troops into France, and march to the assistance
of the duke of Bedford, who was at that time hard
pressed by the Dauphin. In compliance with the regent’s
request, Beaufort repaired with his army to Paris, whence
he soon afterwards proceeded to Bohemia. The terrors of
the crusade, thus aided by the power of the cardinal legate,
did not dismay the heretics, who rushed to the combat with
unabated fury, and routed the army of the church. The
pontiff, sensibly mortified by this disaster, and attributing
the ill success of his arms to the imprudence of Beaufort,
recalled that haughty prelate, substituting in his place
Bartolomeo da Piacenza. The new legate was not more
fortunate than his predecessor. The orthodox army still
continued to experience a series of defeats. Hoping that
a change of his representative might effect a change in the
fortune of his arms, Martin superseded Bartolomeo da<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
Piacenza, and committed the direction of the war to
Giuliano Cæsarino, Cardinal of St. Angelo.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>This was one of the last acts of the pontificate of
Martin V., who died on the 20th of February, 1431.
Though this pontiff was unable to accomplish the extinction
of heresy, he had the good fortune to witness the termination
of the famous schism of the West. Benedict XII.
dying at Paniscola in the year 1424, two cardinals who had
adhered to him in the midst of his misfortunes, at the
instance of Alfonso of Arragon elected as his successor the
Canonico Egidio of Barcelona, who, accepting the empty
title bestowed upon him by this diminutive conclave, assumed
the appellation of Clement VII. But soon after this
transaction, Martin, having composed his differences with
Alfonso, sent a legate into Spain, who easily persuaded
Egidio, in consideration of the gift of the bishopric of
Majorca, to abdicate the vain honours which rendered him
ridiculous, and to renounce all claim to the pontifical dignity.
In order to prevent the cardinals who had placed the
tiara on the head of Egidio from again disturbing the
peace of the church by proceeding to a new election, the
Italian legate caused them to be arrested and thrown into
prison.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>Thus were the latter days of Martin V. passed in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
a state of tranquillity, which was disturbed only by the
rumours of the distant war in Bohemia, and by a transitory
revolt of the citizens of Bologna, who, after a feeble attempt
to vindicate their freedom, were soon reduced to
their wonted subjection. The fear of the plague, indeed,
which at this period occasionally manifested itself at Rome,
compelled the Pontiff to fly for safety to the neighbouring
villages. When on these hasty removals his master
required his attendance, Poggio devoted himself to a
careful examination of the remains of antiquity, which
were to be found in the places where the Papal court from
time to time fixed its temporary residence. But whenever
he was enabled to return to Rome, he took advantage of
this period of domestic quiet to prosecute his studies.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>
He was now deeply engaged in the composition and correction
of various works, and among the rest, of his dialogue
on Avarice, which he submitted to the inspection of Niccolo
Niccoli and others of his literary friends, in the year 1429.
In the prefatory address to Francesco Barbaro, which is
prefixed to this dialogue, he intimates, that he had not yet
made a sufficient progress in the Greek language to be able
to present to the public what was at that time held in the
highest estimation—a version of any of the Græcian classics;
but at the same time expresses his hopes, that this his
first essay may be deemed not altogether destitute of merit.
It should seem, however, that when he had given the last
polish to his work, he was induced for a while to suppress it.
Martin V. was impeached of the vice of avarice; and his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
secretary, whilst he did ample justice to the kind feelings
of his master, was doubtful how far it would be prudent,
by the publication of his dialogue, to run the risk of the
imputation of making his sole failing the object of satirical
comment.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Besides this, Niccolo Niccoli, in perusing the
work in question, without reserve declared his opinion that
it was by no means worthy of the known talents of the
author.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Encouraged however by the flattering encomiums
of Francesco Barbaro, and others of his literary friends,
to whom he had communicated his manuscript, and emboldened
by the consciousness which he felt, that when compared
with the productions of the times, his dialogue was
possessed of considerable merit, he yielded to the suggestions
of scholastic ambition; and immediately after the
death of Martin V. by its publication proclaimed himself a
candidate for the laurel of literary fame.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>In the introduction to the dialogue on Avarice, Poggio
intimates that Antonio Lusco, Cincio, and others of
the pope’s secretaries, paying a visit to Bartolomeo di
Montepulciano, the conversation after supper turned upon
the character of Bernardino,<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> a famous preacher who was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
at that time exercising his talents at Rome. After a very
favourable testimony to this preacher’s merits on the part
of Lusco, Cincio observes, “In one respect both Bernardino
and other preachers of the same description seem to
me to fall into an error. They do not preach with a
view of doing good, but for the purpose of displaying
their eloquence. They are not so anxious to cure the
mental diseases which they profess to heal, as to obtain
the favour and applause of the mob. They learn a few
phrases by heart, and utter them indiscriminately before
audiences of every description. Treating of recondite
and obscure matters, they soar beyond the comprehension
of the vulgar, and tickle the ears of women and fools,
whom they dismiss as ignorant as they found them.
Some vices they reprove in such a manner that they seem
rather to teach, than to correct them, and in their thirst
for gain, they forget the promotion of the cause of
religion.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span></p>

<p>After various other observations have been made on
the defects of the preachers of that time, Bartolomeo
remarks, that though luxury and avarice are the most
copious sources of vice, these failings are rarely reprehended
from the pulpit; or if at any time they happen to become
the subject of clerical animadversion, they are treated in a
dry, jejune and ludicrous manner, without dignity of
thought or energy of expression. He therefore proposes
that the company then assembled should, in a friendly
conversation, enter into a discussion of the nature of these
vices. To this proposal Lusco assents, expressing, however,
his opinion, that it will be advisable for them to
confine themselves to the subject of Avarice. While they
are arranging the order in which they are to deliver their
sentiments, they are joined by Andrew of Constantinople,
a man of great erudition, and the most respectable character.
After the interchange of the customary salutations,
the new guest is informed of the proposed subject of discourse,
and Bartolomeo proceeds to utter an eloquent
invective against Avarice. This oration being ended,
Lusco replies in extenuation of that vice, and in the course
of his harangue reprobates the opposite error of luxury and
extravagance. Lusco’s speech displays considerable ingenuity.
The most striking passages which it contains are
levelled against the professors of the civil law, and against
the mendicant friars, both which descriptions of men are
treated with great severity. Alluding to the latter, Lusco
says, “Look through the whole city—the market—the
streets—the churches—and if you can find any body
who professes that he wishes for no more than a bare<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
sufficiency, depend upon it you have found a prodigious
rarity. Do not cite as instances in contradiction to my
assertion, those slovenly hypocritical vagabonds, who,
under the pretext of religion, get their living without
labour, and make their pretended poverty and contempt
of worldly things a most copious source of gain. A well
constituted state will not encourage these lazy rogues, but
it will prefer those citizens who are willing to work for
the benefit of the human race.”<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>Andrew of Constantinople, in quality of moderator,
replies to Lusco, and points out the distinction which the
latter had artfully confounded, between a desire of the
good things of life, and Avarice. This desire, says he, if
moderate, is virtuous; if immoderate, it degenerates into
covetousness, and becomes a vice. He then proceeds to
answer the arguments of Lusco in regular order. In the
course of his harangue he takes occasion to stigmatize the
avaricious disposition of sovereign princes, and of the
clergy; and in conclusion he supports his opinion by
various quotations from the fathers and the ancient classic
authors. The remarks of Andrew meeting the approbation
of his auditors, the conference is closed.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span></p>

<p>In the sentiments of disapprobation with which the
good taste of Poggio led him to regard the harangues of
the popular preachers of his time, he is supported by the
weighty suffrage of Tiraboschi. “Some of the sacred
orators of the fifteenth century,” says that judicious critic,
“are mentioned with praise, not merely by vulgar and
unpolished, but also by the most cultivated writers.—On
the other hand, we have an opportunity of inspecting
the discourses of these famed orators; and generally
speaking, we cannot see in them the shadow of that
eloquence for which they are so highly commended. Let
any one read the sermons of S. Bernardino da Siena,
Fra Roberto da Lecce, B. Alberto da Sarteano, Fra
Michele da Carcano, and of many others, who, as the
writers of that age inform us, attracted whole cities and
provinces to hear them: and then judge whether they
deserve the character of eloquent orations. They are
generally nothing more than dry treatises on scholastic
points, or on matters of theological morality, full of
quotations of sacred and profane authors, where we see
coupled together St. Augustine and Virgil, Chrysostom
and Juvenal. The force of their eloquence consists in
some exclamations, to which is sometimes joined a description
of the vices of the times, which would now excite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
the most immoderate laughter, but which then caused the
audience to melt into tears.”<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>The friars whom Poggio satirizes with such severity in
his dialogue on Avarice, were a branch of the order of
Franciscans, who, on account of the extraordinary strictness
with which they professed to exercise their conventual discipline,
were distinguished by the title of <i>Fratres Observantiæ</i>.
The founder of this new subdivision of the ecclesiastical
order was the above-mentioned Bernardino, of
Siena, who appears by the testimony of Poggio to have
been a man of great virtue and of considerable talents.
Several of his disciples, however, who were not endued
either with his good principles or his abilities, emulous of
the reputation which he had acquired by preaching, began
also to harangue the people from the pulpit.</p>

<p>Of these self-constituted instructors Poggio has drawn
the following striking picture. “Inflated by the pretended
inspiration of the Holy Spirit, they expound the sacred
scriptures to the populace with such gross ignorance, that
nothing can exceed their folly. I have often gone to hear
them for the sake of amusement; for they were in the
habit of saying things, which would move to laughter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
the gravest and most phlegmatic man on the face of the
earth. You might see them throwing themselves about
as if they were ready to leap out of the pulpit; now
raising their voices to the highest pitch of fury—now
sinking into a conciliatory whisper—sometimes they beat
the desk with their hands—sometimes they laughed, and
in the course of their babbling they assumed as many
forms as Proteus. Indeed they are more like monkeys
than preachers, and have no qualification for their profession,
except an unwearied pair of lungs.”<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>Though the impudence of these men, which was equal
to their folly, disgusted people of good sense, they had
numerous partizans and admirers among the populace.
Elated by their success, they arrogated to themselves considerable
consequence. Some of them, in the pride of their
hearts, scorned to hold inferior stations in the convents in
which they were established, and solicited the erection of
new monasteries, of which their ambition prompted them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
to expect to become the superiors. Scandalized by these
irregularities, the assertors of discipline summoned an
assembly of the brothers of the Franciscan order from every
province of Italy, for the purpose of remedying these evils,
which were likely to bring disgrace upon their fraternity.
This assembly, which consisted of eighty members, decreed,
that a general chapter of their order should be held
on the ensuing feast of Pentecost—that in the interim, six
only of the friars should be allowed to preach—and that
no new convent should be erected for the accommodation
of the Franciscans, till the pleasure of the above-mentioned
general chapter should be known. The task of drawing up
these decrees was assigned to Poggio—a task which it may
be presumed he undertook with pleasure, and executed with
fidelity. The mortified preachers and their partizans, imagining
that Poggio was not only the registrer, but the
author of these unwelcome restrictions, inveighed against
his conduct with great bitterness. Soon after the publication
of the above-mentioned decree, Carlo Ricascolo, a
devout citizen of Florence, presented to the <i>Fratres
Observantiæ</i> a small estate pleasantly situated in the neighbourhood
of Arezzo. On this estate the friars immediately
began, in defiance of the prohibition so lately issued by
the heads of their order, to lay the foundation of a new
monastery. Poggio thought it his duty to represent this
act of contumacy to the pontiff, who immediately issued
orders to the bishop of Fiesole to put a stop to the prosecution
of the building. This circumstance still farther
excited against Poggio the animosity of the indignant
ecclesiastics, who industriously vilified his character, representing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
him as an enemy of the Christian faith, and a
malignant persecutor of the true believers. Niccolo
Niccoli, with his usual impetuosity, gave credit to these
accusations, and wrote to Poggio a letter of remonstrance.
To this letter Poggio replied, first simply stating the facts
of the case, and then protesting that he was no enemy
either to religion or its professors—“on the contrary,”
says he, “I make a point of behaving with the utmost
reverence to those ecclesiastics who adorn their religion
with virtuous conduct. But,” proceeded he, “I have
been so often deceived, so frequently disappointed in the
good opinion which I had conceived of men, that I
know not whom or what to believe. There are so many
wicked people, who conceal their vices by the sanctity
of their looks, and the humility of their apparel, that
confidence is in a manner destroyed. In the pontifical
court we have too many opportunities of becoming
acquainted with iniquitous transactions, of which people
in general are ignorant. I am not however surprised,”
says he in the conclusion of his letter, “that these friars
should complain of their being prevented from establishing
themselves in such a pleasant district. The excellence
of our wine is a powerful allurement, both to strangers
and to our own countrymen. Plato, who was no Christian,
chose for the scite of his academy an unhealthy spot, in
order that the mind might gain strength by the infirmity
of the body. But these pretended followers of Christ
act upon a different system. They select pleasant and
voluptuous places—they seek not solitude, but society—they
do not wish to promote the cultivation of the mind,
but the pampering of the corporeal appetites.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span></p>

<p>These sarcasms were communicated by Niccolo to
Alberto da Sarteano,<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> a brother of the Franciscan order,
who was so much displeased by them, that he expostulated
with Poggio on the alleged impropriety of his conduct,
in a long letter, to which the latter replied in a grave strain
of irony, defending and confirming the remarks which had
been so copious a subject of animadversion. Towards the
conclusion of his letter, he bestowed upon his correspondent
the following seasonable advice. “Do you apply
yourself to your preaching, and attend to your peculiar
province. Leave the building of religious houses to
others, and be assured, that wheresoever you are, there
you may acceptably serve and worship God.”</p>

<p>This letter to Alberto, Poggio enclosed in another,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
which he addressed to Ambrogio Traversari. To the
learned monk of Camaldoli he could venture to write, even
upon this delicate subject, with all the freedom of jocularity.
“I cannot help thinking,” says he, “that the
benevolence of many persons is too great, who prefer the
public good to their private interest; and who, through
their anxiety for the salvation of others, lose their own
souls. I could wish that these men would retire to
woods and deserts, where they might attain to the perfection
of holy living, rather than settle in such pleasant
places, in which they run such risk of falling into temptation.
Your favourite St. Jerome says, that it is better
and safer to be in a situation where it is impossible to err,
than even to escape from imminent danger. I am afraid
some people have too much confidence in their own fortitude.
But I have done.—Let every one bear his own
burden.—Farewell, and pray that your friend Poggio may
amend his ways.”<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>The lenient influence of time did not abate the dislike
and contempt which Poggio entertained for those ecclesiastics
who adopted the religious habit as a convenient cloak
for the concealment of indolence or luxury; and who, by
the mere appearance of extraordinary sanctity, endeavoured
to attain those worldly honours which they affected to despise.
When he was declined into the vale of years, he
attacked those pests of society in a dialogue on Hypocrisy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
a composition which abounds in the keen sarcasms of polished
wit, and in acute observations on the human character.
It is no doubt on account of the boldness with
which he inveighs against the evil practices of pretenders
to uncommon strictness in the observance of religious
duties, that the editors of his works have suppressed this
dialogue, which has been preserved and circulated by the
industrious zeal of protestantism.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> The freedom with
which he therein speaks of the vices, not merely of individuals,
but of whole classes of religious hypocrites, is truly
astonishing. The following remonstrance against the folly
and wickedness of the monastic life savours more of the
eighteenth, than of the fifteenth century, and is drawn up
in the spirit of a Gallic <i>œconomiste</i>, rather than in the
style of a secretary to the sovereign pontiff. “I do not
wish to scrutinize into the secret life of these cœnobites,
which is known only to God. I will not inquire whether
they are sober or otherwise; whether they are chaste or
unchaste; whether they employ their time in study, or
waste it in idleness; whether they are the prey of envy;
and whether they are continually hunting after preferment.
It is not sufficient that they keep within doors,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
oppressed with a load of garments, and do no public and
open mischief. Let me ask, of what utility are they to
the faith, and what advantage do they confer on the
public? I cannot find that they do any thing but sing
like grasshoppers, and I cannot help thinking they are
too liberally paid for the mere exercise of their lungs.
But they extol their labours as a kind of Herculean task,
because they rise in the night to chant the praises of God.
This is no doubt an extraordinary proof of merit, that
they sit up to exercise themselves in psalmody. What
would they say if they rose to go to the plough, like
farmers, exposed to the wind and rain, with bare feet,
and with their bodies thinly clad? In such a case no
doubt the Deity could not possibly requite them for their
toil and sufferings. But it may be said, there are many
worthy men amongst them. I acknowledge it. It would
be a lamentable thing indeed, should there be no good
men in so vast a multitude. But the majority of them
are idle, hypocritical, and destitute of virtue. How
many do you think enter upon the religious life through a
desire to amend their morals? You can recount very
few who do not assume the habit on account of some
extraneous cause. They dedicate, not their minds, but
their bodies to devotional exercises. Many adopt the
monastic garb on account of the imbecility of their
spirits, which prevents them from exerting themselves to
gain an honest livelihood. Some, when they have spent
their property in extravagance, enter into religious houses,
because they think that they shall there find a rich pasture;
others are induced to hide in these abodes the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
infamy which they have contracted by their ignorance, and
by their dissolute and abandoned course of life.”</p>

<p>In the same dialogue Poggio recounts several instances
of artful priests abusing the confidence of auricular confession,
for the indulgence of their licentious appetites. He
also mentions, with due reprobation, a set of fanatical profligates,
who propagating and acting upon the doctrine, that
those who were in a state of grace were made perfect, and
could not possibly commit sin, had lately debauched a considerable
number of women in the city of Venice.</p>

<p>In modern times, enthusiasts have the audacity, whilst
they make a public acknowledgment of gross violations of
the duties of morality, to proclaim their confidence, that
their sins are forgiven, and to declare their firm persuasion,
that whatever may be the complexion of their future conduct,
they cannot forfeit the favour of the Almighty.
Though it would be unjust to charge these men with an
imitation of the actions of the sanctimonious Venetians,
whose vile deeds are recorded by Poggio, certain it is, that
their principles, if carried into practice, would grant a
license even to these flagrant acts of wickedness. Thus, in
the wide circle of immorality, there is a point, where the
extreme of enthusiasm and the extreme of libertinism meet
together. When reason is shaken from her throne, the
passions make even Religion herself the promoter and the
instrument of vice.</p>

<p>On the death of Martin V., Gabriello de’ Condolmieri,
a Venetian, of an ancient, though not of a noble family,
was elevated to the pontifical dignity. During his residence
in his native country, Gabriello had not obtained any high
ecclesiastical honours: but being persuaded to repair to
Rome under the protection of a nephew of his countryman
Gregory XII., he so skilfully insinuated himself into the
good graces of that pontiff, that by his favour he was promoted
to the lucrative office of treasurer of the holy see;
and successively advanced to the episcopal throne of Siena,
and to the dignity of Cardinal of St. Clement. Having
conducted himself with singular spirit and steadiness in the
execution of various important commissions with which he
was entrusted by Gregory XII. and his successors, he daily
increased his reputation; and on the vacancy of the pontifical
chair, occasioned by the demise of Martin V., he was
raised, by the vote of the conclave, to the summit of ecclesiastical
preferment. [March 3rd. A. D. 1431.] On this
occasion, in compliance with the established custom, he
changed his name, and assumed the appellation of Eugenius
IV.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span></p>

<p>During the course of the fifteenth century, the peace
of most of the cities of Italy was continually disturbed by
the intrigues of rival families, who disputed with each other
the distribution of municipal honours, and the possession of
civic power. On the accession of Eugenius, the contentions
of the Colonnas and the Orsini, who had long presided at
the head of opposite factions, still gave rise to disorder and
tumult in Rome. The new pontiff had no sooner ascended
the chair of St. Peter, than the chiefs of the latter family
directed his attention to the great wealth which their competitors
had amassed, in consequence of the partiality
which his predecessor had shewn towards his kinsmen, in
the distribution of the honours and emoluments which were
at the disposal of the head of the church. On an inquiry
being made into the conduct of the Colonnas, it was found
that, not contented with the sum which they had gained
from the munificence of their uncle, they had taken possession
of the public treasure, which he had appropriated
to the liquidation of the expenses of an expedition against
the Turks, and had also conveyed away several jewels, and
much furniture belonging to the pontifical palace. Being
therefore determined to take legal proceedings against the
principal offenders, Eugenius ordered Stefano Colonna,
the general of the church, to arrest Oddo Piccio, Vice-chamberlain
of his predecessor, but to treat him with civility.
These orders were ill obeyed. The guards sent on this
duty sacked the house of Oddo, and ignominiously dragged
him through the streets as a common criminal. The pontiff
having threatened to call Stefano to account for this
harsh conduct, the latter fled from Rome, and joined the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
rest of his family in a rebellion against Eugenius. Provoked
by this contumacy, the pontiff proceeded with such
unsparing severity against those who had been elevated to
places of honour and profit, by the favour of his predecessor,
that more than two hundred persons employed by
Martin V. in various offices, were, upon being convicted of
various offences, put to death by the hand of the executioner.
The sagacity of Poggio, who was a witness of these
cruel transactions, clearly foresaw the evil consequences
which were likely to result from them.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> The distractions
of civil tumult soon demonstrated the justice of his apprehensions.
The Colonnas, flying from Rome, solicited the
assistance of their powerful relatives and friends, who
resided in various parts of Italy. Having collected a sufficient
body of troops, they marched to Rome; and being
admitted into the city through the Appian gate by some of
their partizans, they directed their course to the Piazza Colonna,
where they were met by the soldiers of the pope. After
a fierce encounter, the assailants were compelled to retire.
Being thus frustrated in their attempt to make themselves
masters of the city by open force, they endeavoured to
accomplish their purpose by treachery. The vigilance of
Eugenius however rendered their designs abortive. Having
received intelligence that the archbishop of Benevento, the
son of Antonio Colonna, and Masio his brother, were
meditating some desperate enterprise, he caused them to be
apprehended. Masio being put to the torture, confessed
that they had laid a plan to seize the castle of St. Angelo,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
and to banish the pope and the Orsini from Rome. This
treasonable project the unfortunate youth expiated by his
death. He was beheaded in the Campo di Fiore, and his
quarters were suspended to public view in four of the most
frequented streets of the city. Soon after this event, the
heart of Eugenius being mollified by a dangerous sickness,
he became weary of the violence and hazard of civil strife;
and by the medium of Angelotto Fosco, a citizen of
Rome, he intimated to the Colonnas, that he was disposed
to agree to a pacification. The terms of this pacification
being settled, and solemnly proclaimed on the twenty-second
of September, [A. D. 1471.] Rome once more
enjoyed the blessing of domestic tranquillity.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>Thus did the merciless harshness of Eugenius, on his
accession to the chair of St. Peter, expose his capital to
the miseries of civil discord. At the same time he rashly
ran the hazard of involving himself in a war with Filippo
Maria, the duke of Milan. After the conclusion of the
peace of Ferrara, that crafty prince, with a view of inducing
his most formidable antagonists to exhaust their strength,
had encouraged the Florentines to attack the territories of
the republic of Lucca, which had incurred the hatred of the
Tuscans by the strenuous assistance which it had afforded
to the duke in the late war. But while he professed
to desert his former allies, Filippo secretly ordered the
Genoese, over whom he exercised an almost absolute<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
authority, to march to the relief of the city of Lucca,
which the Florentines had reduced to extremity. In
obedience to his injunctions, the Genoese sent into the
Lucchese territories a considerable body of troops under
the command of Piccinino, who compelled the Tuscan
general to raise the siege of the capital, and entirely
routed his army. When the Florentines were apprized
of the secret machinations of the duke of Milan, they
renewed their alliance with the Venetians: and on the
other hand, the duke openly declaring himself in favour
of the republic of Lucca, strengthened himself by the
assistance of the Sienese. Such was the state of affairs
in the western districts of Italy, when Eugenius was called
to ascend the pontifical throne. This event was a subject
of great joy to the Florentines, who hoped that the
partiality of the new pontiff to his countrymen, their
allies, would induce him to take decisive measures in their
favour. Nor were they disappointed. Soon after his
accession, Eugenius sent a legate to Siena, with instructions
to endeavour to prevail upon the administrators of
that republic to desert from the cause of the duke of Milan.
At the same time he sent to the Tuscan army a reinforcement
of one thousand horse, which seasonable accession
of strength enabled the Florentines once more to commence
the siege of Lucca.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>The duke of Milan did not deem it expedient instantly
to resent the proceedings of the pontiff: but the edge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
of his anger was not blunted by time, and when a convenient
opportunity presented itself, he convinced Eugenius
to his cost, that it is the height of folly gratuitously to
interfere in the disputes of belligerent states.</p>

<p>The pontificate of Eugenius did not commence with
happier omens in the distant provinces of Christendom.
He had confirmed the commission of his predecessor,
which authorised Julian, cardinal of St. Angelo, to exercise
in Germany the office of legate of the holy see; and in
pursuance of this commission, the cardinal had laboured
with unremitting activity for the extinction of heresy.
The Bohemian reformers, however, ridiculed his pastoral
admonitions, and despised his menaces. During his residence
in Constance, Poggio had witnessed in the case of
two individuals, the intrepidity with which the human
mind is inspired by the operation of religious zeal; and he
seems to have wisely calculated the efforts which this
powerful stimulus was likely to produce, by diffusing its
increasing energy through the breasts of an enthusiastic
multitude. On this account, when he was informed of the
important enterprise which had been undertaken by his
friend the cardinal, though he applauded the alacrity which
he manifested in the discharge of his duty to his spiritual
sovereign, he advised him maturely to consider, not the
degree of courage with which he was endowed, but the
number of troops which he could bring into the field; and
bade him beware, lest in attempting to subdue the heretics,
he should take a wolf by the ears.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> The event justified<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
the fears of Poggio. A vigorous invasion of Bohemia
was meditated by Frederic, marquis of Brandenburg, who
had been appointed to the chief command of the ecclesiastical
forces;<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> but as the success of his plan in a great
measure depended on the co-operation of several independent
powers, it experienced the usual fate of enterprizes
conducted on that most hazardous principle. It had been
concerted, that whilst the marquis of Brandenburg made
an irruption into the Bohemian territory by the route of
Thopa, Albert duke of Austria should make a diversion
on the side of Moravia. But as some of the confederates
had not prepared their forces in due time, the commander
in chief was obliged to defer the opening of the campaign
beyond the appointed period. In the mean time Albert
advanced into Bohemia; but finding himself unsupported
by his allies, he thought it prudent to retire. The duke
of Austria had no sooner withdrawn his forces, than the
cardinal, who had at length raised an army, consisting of
forty thousand cavalry, and nearly an equal number of
infantry,<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> appeared on the frontiers of Bohemia, where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
he took and destroyed several towns which had been
garrisoned by the reformers. The Bohemians were not,
however, discouraged by the number of their foes, but
boldly advanced with a determination to give them battle.
The papal forces did not await the encounter of these
formidable antagonists. When they were apprized of the
approach of the enemy, they were seized with a sudden
panic, and in spite of the remonstrances of their general,
they fled in the utmost disorder.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> Mortified by this
defeat, and despairing of being able to subdue the heretics
by means of the forces at present under his command, the
legate determined to apply for assistance in the task of
the extirpation of the impugners of the true faith to the
general council, which, in pursuance of the summons of
the late pontiff Martin V., was soon to be held in the city
of Basil.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>When Poggio received the intelligence of the discomfiture<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
of the papal army, he thus addressed the Cardinal
legate, in a consolatory epistle.—“I am truly sorry,
my good father, for the ridiculous and disgraceful issue
of this German expedition, which you have planned and
prepared with so much pains and labour. It is astonishing
that your troops should have been so completely destitute
of courage, as to fly like hares, terrified by an empty
breeze of wind, even before the enemy was in sight. My
grief is however alleviated by the following consideration,
that I not only foresaw this event, but foretold it when
I last had the pleasure of conversing with you. On that
occasion I remember you treated my opinion lightly, and
said, that as prophets of evil were generally justified by
the common course of human things, I prophesied on
the safe side when I foreboded disasters. I did not however
hazard a random guess at the issue of the proposed
expedition; but formed a rational conjecture on the
subject, by comparing past with present circumstances,
and by reflecting upon the necessary relation of cause and
effect. Impressed by these ideas, I thought I clearly foresaw
an approaching tempest: and the occurrences of
every succeeding day tend to confirm me in my opinion.
There formerly existed Christian kings and princes, by
whose assistance the church defended herself against her
enemies; and tempest-tossed as she has frequently been,
she has hitherto always found some haven in which she
could shelter herself from the fury of the storm. But
whither can she now flee without incurring the danger of
suffering shipwreck? A common insanity has persuaded
almost all men to rejoice in our calamities, and to pray for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
our destruction. Let us however hope for the best, and
patiently bear the worst. For my own part I make it
my study, in all circumstances to be resigned to the will of
Providence, and to become so independent of externals, as
not to be distressed by the capriciousness of fortune. In
my present situation, indeed, I am not very obnoxious to
the malice of that goddess, whose wrath, like the thunderbolt,
is directed against the high and the lofty. But
whatever may be her pleasure, it is certainly the truest
wisdom not to suffer our minds to be shaken by her
impulse, and not to be too deeply affected in our private
capacity by the distresses of the public. Let us however
entreat the Deity not to put our wisdom to these serious
proofs; for we know not whether we should be able to
practise the piety and philosophy which we recommend.
I hear that you have convoked a council, which is already
well attended. I commend your prudence—you did
well, on the ill success of your arms, to have recourse to
an assembly of priests, on whom we cannot but have great
reliance, on account of the uprightness of their lives, and
their zeal to extinguish the pest of heresy.</p>

<p>“The Germans were formerly a warlike people.—They
are now strenuous only in their eating and drinking,
and they are mighty in proportion to the wine which
they can swallow. When their casks are empty, their
courage must needs be exhausted. On this account I
am inclined to think, that they so shamefully deserted
their posts, not through fear of the enemy, whom it
seems they never saw, but because provisions were scarce<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
in those quarters. You were of opinion, that sobriety
constituted a part of the soldier’s duty. But if this
expedition is to be again attempted, I trust you will
change your system, and allow that wine constitutes the
sinews of war. The ancients inform us, that Ennius
never undertook to celebrate warlike achievements till
he was mellow; and it must be acknowledged that,
inasmuch as it is a more serious task to fight a battle than
to describe it, flowing cups are absolutely requisite to
enable a man to handle arms, and encounter the dangers
of the field. I am afraid you have fallen into the error
of judging of others by your own dispositions. Beware
of repeating this error in the matter of the council, and
remember what I said to you before your departure from
Italy—take care to feed them well—But enough of this
levity. We enjoy the blessing of peace; but the pontifical
court is poor, and shorn of its splendour. This is
occasioned by the war in Germany, and by the sickness
of his holiness, which has lasted much longer, and has
been much more severe, than could have been wished.
I have written to Angelotto, cardinal of St. Mark, a
letter which I wish you also to read. I therefore send
you a copy of it, not because I flatter myself that there
is any excellence in its style, but because I trust its
perusal may divert your thoughts from the anxious affair
of the council.”<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>A mind irritated by disappointment and disgrace is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
but ill prepared to bear with patience the lashes of satiric
wit. The cardinal of St. Angelo was by no means pleased
with the jocular style of Poggio’s letter; and though he
affected to answer it in a similar strain of levity, he appears
to have written with the ill grace which generally betrays
the attempt to conceal resentment under the veil of good
humour; and in the course of his epistle, his vexation
burst forth in an angry reproof of the irregular life of his
correspondent. Unfortunately the morals of Poggio were
not entirely free from reproach.—Whilst the uncertainty
of his future destination had prevented him from entering
into the married state, his passions had gained the mastery
over his principles, and he had become the father of a
spurious offspring. Reminding him of this circumstance,
“you have children,” said the cardinal, “which is inconsistent
with the obligations of an ecclesiastic; and by a
mistress, which is discreditable to the character of a layman.”
To these reproaches Poggio replied in a letter
replete with the keenest sarcasm. He pleaded guilty to
the charge which had been exhibited against him, and candidly
confessed, that he had deviated from the paths of
virtue. “I might answer to your accusation,” said he,
“that I have children, which is expedient for the laity;
and by a mistress, in conformity to the custom of the
clergy from the foundation of the world. But I will not
defend my errors—you know that I have violated the
laws of morality, and I acknowledge that I have done
amiss.” Endeavouring however to palliate his offence—“do
we not,” says he, “every day, and in all countries,
meet with priests, monks, abbots, bishops, and dignitaries<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
of a still higher order, who have families of children
by married women, widows, and even by virgins
consecrated to the service of God? These despisers of
worldly things, as they style themselves, who travel from
place to place, clothed in coarse and vile raiment, with
downcast looks, calling on the name of Jesus, follow
the precept of the apostle, and seek after that which is
not their own, to use it as their own, and scorn to hide
their talent in a napkin. I have often laughed at the
bold, or rather impudent profession of a certain Italian
abbot, who waited on Martin V., accompanied by his
son, who was grown up to man’s estate. This audacious
ecclesiastic, being interrogated on the subject, freely and
openly declared, to the great amusement of the pope,
and the whole pontifical court, that he had four other
sons able to bear arms, who were all at his holiness’s
service.” After noticing other scandalous enormities,
which brought disgrace upon the character of some ecclesiastics
of those times, Poggio thus concluded—“As to
your advice on the subject of my future plans of life,
I am determined not to assume the sacerdotal office;
for I have seen many men whom I have regarded as
persons of good character and liberal dispositions,
degenerate into avarice, sloth, and dissipation, in consequence
of their introduction into the priesthood.—Fearing
lest this should be the case with myself, I have
resolved to spend the remaining term of my pilgrimage
as a layman; for I have too frequently observed, that
your brethren, at the time of their tonsure, not only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
part with their hair, but also with their conscience and
their virtue.”<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>Angelotto, cardinal of St. Mark, whom Poggio mentions
at the conclusion of his consolatory epistle to the
cardinal of St. Angelo, was by birth a Roman, and was
promoted by Eugenius, from the bishopric of Cavi, to a
seat in the sacred college, on the nineteenth of September,
1431.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> On this addition to his honours, Poggio addressed
to him a letter, in which he exercised the privilege of
friendship, in administering to him much wholesome and
seasonable advice. He introduced his admonitions by
observing, that it was customary for the friends of those
who had been exalted to any new dignity, to express
their congratulations by the transmission of magnificent
presents; but that being prevented by his poverty from
giving such indications of the satisfaction with which he
had received the intelligence of Angelotto’s promotion,
he was determined to bestow upon him a gift, which he
was assured he would value at its just rate—the gift of
friendly council. By a variety of instances, recorded in
the pages of history, he shewed, that he who in compliance
with the dictates of duty gives good advice to the
great and powerful, runs considerable risk of drawing
down upon himself the indignation of those whose welfare
he wishes to promote by the free communication of
his opinions. In candidly imparting his sentiments to
Angelotto, however, a man of considerable learning, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
had himself been accustomed to indulge in the most
unlimited freedom of speech, he declared that he did
not apprehend that he incurred the least danger of giving
offence. He then proceeded to exhort the newly created
cardinal to continue to cultivate, in his present high station,
those virtues which he had exhibited in the inferior
degrees of ecclesiastical preferment; and to act up to the
professions which he had been accustomed to make before
the period of his exaltation. He reminded him of the dangerous
temptations which surround eminence of rank, and
assured him, that so far from withdrawing any restraints
to which he had formerly been obliged to submit, his present
promotion imposed upon him additional obligations
to be prudent and circumspect in his conduct; since the
splendour of eminence makes the failings and vices of the
great the more conspicuous. Warning his correspondent
against the debasing influence of flattery, he thus apologized
for the boldness with which he offered his advice.
“Those who are not acquainted with me, will perhaps
condemn the freedom with which I inculcate these
heads of admonition on one who is more fully instructed
than myself on such topics. But I am induced
by my affection for you to recall to your memory these
points of duty, in the discharge of which, even the
well informed have been sometimes known to fail.”</p>

<p>If credit may be given to the opinion of Angelotto’s
contemporaries, Poggio’s attempt to inculcate upon him
the lessons of wisdom, was by no means a superfluous
task. In such small estimation was his understanding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
held, that on the day of his election to the dignity of
cardinal, a Roman priest of the name of Lorenzo went
through the streets of the city, shewing indications of the
most extravagant joy; and being asked by his neighbours
what was the cause of his exultation, he replied, “I am
truly fortunate—Angelotto is created cardinal; and since
I find fools and madmen are promoted to that dignity,
I have great hopes of wearing the red hat myself.”<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>
On the same occasion, as the officers of the pontifical
household were conversing about the transactions of the
day, one Niccolo of Anagni, a man of great literary
accomplishments, but of an irregular life, and of a very
satirical disposition, complained of his own ill fortune.—“No
person living,” said he, “is more unlucky than
myself; for though this is the reign of folly, and every
madman, nay even Angelotto, gains considerable promotion,
I alone am passed over without notice.”<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> The
friendship which Poggio professed to entertain for the
newly created dignitary did not prevent him from indulging
at his expense, his propensity to sarcastic wit. A new
cardinal is not permitted to take any part in the debates of
the consistory till he has obtained the pontiff’s permission
to speak, which is granted by the performance of a short
ceremony, entitled the opening of his mouth. Poggio
one day meeting the cardinal of St. Marcellus in the
pontifical palace, asked him what had been done that
morning in the sacred college. “We have opened Angelotto’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
mouth,” said the cardinal. “Indeed,” replied
Poggio, “you would have acted more wisely if you had
fixed a padlock upon it.”<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> These anecdotes, which are
selected from Poggio’s <i>Facetiæ</i>, sufficiently prove, that
the unfortunate cardinal of St. Mark was a fruitful subject
of ridicule to the officers of the Roman court. From the
same source of information it appears, that his churlish
moroseness on the following occasion subjected him to the
shame of being put to confusion by the petulant wit of a
child. Some of his friends having introduced to him a
boy of ten years of age, who was remarkable for the brilliancy
of his talents, he asked him a variety of questions,
in his answers to which the boy displayed astonishing
knowledge and sagacity. On which Angelotto, turning to
the by-standers, said, “They who manifest such quickness
of parts at this early age, generally decrease in
intellect as they increase in years, and become fools when
they have attained to maturity.” Hurt by the unfeeling
rudeness of this remark, the stripling immediately replied,
“If this be the case, most reverend father, you must have
been a very forward youth.”<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>In congratulating a man of Angelotto’s character on
his accession to high ecclesiastical honours, Poggio may
be suspected of practising the duplicity of a courtier. But
it may be alleged in his defence, that his letter breathes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
the spirit of freedom; and that though he takes occasion
in general terms to commend the talents and virtues of
the new cardinal, his commendations are so sparingly interspersed
in the midst of a variety of salutary hints of
advice, that they are evidently introduced for no other
purpose than to render his admonitions more palatable,
and consequently more useful. We have too much reason
to believe that these admonitions were like good seed
sown in an unproductive soil; and that the conduct of
Angelotto, subsequent to his elevation to a seat in the
consistory, reflected disgrace on himself, and on the
authors of his promotion.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>In summoning the general council, cardinal Julian
had acted in conformity to the powers which had been
conferred on him by the late, and confirmed by the present
pontiff;<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> but Eugenius, though he did not think
it advisable openly to oppose this measure, looked forward
to the convening of this assembly with no small<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
degree of apprehension. The popes had always regarded
general councils with the jealousy which monarchs of
arbitrary principles uniformly entertain of those constitutional
bodies, which, under various denominations, have
occasionally attempted to curb the pride of despotic authority.
In the deposition of John XXII. the council of
Constance had established a most dangerous precedent;
and when Eugenius reflected upon the power and activity
of his enemies, he dreaded the consequences which might
result from the assembling of a deliberative body, which
claimed a superiority over the head of the church. The
cardinal of St. Angelo, however, either was not acquainted
with the views of the pontiff, or thought it his
duty not to sacrifice the interests of the Christian community
to the timidity or ambition of its spiritual sovereign.
In compliance with his injunctions, John de Polmar,
auditor of the sacred palace, and John de Ragusio,
doctor in theology of the university of Paris, repaired to
Basil on the nineteenth of July, 1431, and opened the
council in the chapter house of the cathedral church.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>
On the fourteenth of December the first session was held,
at which the cardinal of St. Angelo presided in person,
and delivered to the assembled ecclesiastics an exhortation
to labour diligently, and to watch with vigilance for the
welfare of the Christian religion. Then were read the
decree of the council of Constance, touching the summoning
of general councils; the instrument by which
the city of Basil was appointed as a proper place for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
holding of such an assembly, and various other documents,
which establish the legitimacy of the present synod.
It was then publicly declared, that the attention of the
council would be directed to three points—the extirpation
of heresy—the prevention of wars amongst Christians—and
the reformation of the church.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>After the publication of a bull, which thundered an
anathema against all those who should impede any one in
his passage to or from the city of Basil, on the business of
the council, and the recital and adoption of several rules
for the regulation of the proceedings of that assembly,
the first session was closed.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>When Eugenius found that he could not prevent the
convocation of the dreaded synod, he began to deliberate
upon the best method of preventing those encroachments<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
upon the pontifical prerogatives, which he had so much
reason to apprehend from its decrees. Upon mature consideration,
he did not think it prudent to risk so bold a
step as the dissolution of the council: but he flattered
himself, that by removing it to some city under his own
dominion, he would be enabled to control its proceedings,
and to avert the threatened danger. He therefore issued
a bull, whereby he commanded the cardinal of St. Angelo
to transfer the council from Basil to Bologna.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> On the
receipt of this bull, the cardinal wrote to Eugenius a long
and elaborate letter, in which he endeavoured to persuade
him by every argument which was likely to influence his
judgment, and by every appeal to the principles of virtue
which was calculated to make an impression on his heart,
to withdraw his opposition to the proceedings of the council,
and to assist with zeal in its efforts to promote the
welfare of the Christian community.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> The members of
that assembly, also, sent deputies to his holiness, with
instructions to implore and require him to retract the
aforesaid bull, and by his assistance and advice to support
the council in the good work which it had begun. The
assembled fathers did not, however, entirely rely upon the
persuasive eloquence of their embassadors. Confiding in
the protection of the emperor Sigismund, in the second
session, which was held on the fifteenth of April, 1432,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
they took very decisive measures for the establishment of
their authority. With this view they recited and confirmed
a decree of the council of Constance, wherein it was
asserted, that every Synod, lawfully assembled in the Holy
Spirit, constituting a general council, and representing the
church militant, derives its authority immediately from
Christ, to which authority all persons, of what state or
dignity soever, not excepting the pope, are bound to pay
obedience in matters pertaining to the faith, the extirpation
of schism, and the general reformation of the church in
its head and members. They also issued a declaration, that
the council then assembled could not legally be dissolved,
prorogued, or transferred to any other place, by any power,
no not even by the pontifical authority, without the consent
of its members.</p>

<p>The deputies who had been sent to Eugenius returning
without having effected the object of their mission,
the council, by a public decree, dated April the twenty-ninth,
1432, supplicated, required, and admonished the
pontiff to revoke the bull of dissolution with the same
formality with which it had been published. By the same
decree, Eugenius was summoned to appear in the council
in the space of three months, either in person or by deputies
furnished with full powers to act in his name. He was
also duly forewarned, that should he refuse to comply with
these requisitions, the council would, according to the
dictates of justice, and the Holy Spirit, provide for the necessities
of the church, and proceed according to the precepts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
of divine and human laws.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> After these acts of open
hostility, prudence dictated to the members of the council
the necessity of abridging the influence and authority of
their adversary as much as possible; and for this purpose,
in their fourth session, which was held on the twentieth of
June, [A. D. 1432.] they decreed, that in case of a vacancy
of the holy see, the successor to Eugenius should be
elected in the place where the council should happen to be
sitting; and that during the existence of that assembly,
the pope should be prohibited from creating new cardinals.</p>

<p>The council proceeded to still more daring extremities.
On Sunday, September 6th, after the solemnization of the
mass, two procurators of that assembly presented a petition,
which set forth, that whereas Eugenius, having been
regularly summoned to revoke the bull which he had issued,
ordaining the dissolution of the council, and also to
appear in person in the said council, within the space of
three months, had neglected to obey the said summons, and
had on the contrary persisted in his endeavours to put a
stop to the proceedings of the legal representatives of the
Christian church, they demanded that the said Eugenius
should be declared contumacious; and that further proceedings
should be had according to law. This petition
having been read, the bishop of Constance, who on that
day presided in the assembly, commanded the bishops of
Perigord and Ratisbon, to make inquisition whether the
pope, or any one duly authorised on his behalf were present<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
in the council. These prelates accordingly made the
requisite proclamation thrice from the steps of the altar,
and as many times at the gates of the church. No one
appearing to answer to this summons, a representation of
this fact was made to the president; after which the archbishops
of Tarento and Colossi, and the bishop of Magdalon,
and Antonio di Santo Vito, auditor of the sacred
palace, entered the assembly in quality of deputies of the
pope. On inquiry, however, it was found, that they were
not provided with the plenary powers demanded by the
decrees of the council, in consequence of which a protestation
was made against their acts. Being, however, permitted
to speak, they exhorted the assembled dignitaries,
as they wished for the good of the church, to drop these
harsh proceedings against the common father of the faithful.
After some deliberation, the president replied in the name
of the council, that the members of that august body
would deliberate upon the matters which had on that day
been proposed to their consideration; and that they would
endeavour to act in such a manner as to obtain the concurrence
of the whole Christian world. After thanking the
president for this gracious answer, the deputies of Eugenius
withdrew.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> On the eighteenth of December the council
was pleased to enlarge the term prescribed for the submission
of Eugenius for the space of sixty days; and at the
same time prohibited all ecclesiastics or others from attempting
to establish at Bologna, or elsewhere, any synod in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
opposition to the council then sitting at Basil.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> At the
expiration of the above-mentioned term of sixty days, the
procurators of the council, on the nineteenth of February,
1433, again demanded sentence against the contumacious
pontiff, and were again informed by the president, that this
important affair would be the subject of the future deliberations
of the assembly.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> The result of these deliberations
was, that the council, out of its great clemency, indulged
Eugenius with the still further space of sixty days, at the
same time declaring, that should he not within that time
fully and unreservedly acknowledge and submit to its authority,
he should stand convicted of notorious contumacy,
and should be suspended from the administration of all
pontifical functions, both in spirituals and in temporals.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>It may easily be imagined, that these violent proceedings
of the council excited no small degree of uneasiness
in the mind of Eugenius. The pride of the pontiff was
wounded by the decree, which pronounced the subordination
of the papal dignity to the mandate of a collective
body, the individual members of which were accustomed
to prostrate themselves before the chair of St. Peter, with
the homage of unreserved submission. His resentment
was roused by the denunciation of the punishment which
awaited his refusal to concur in his own humiliation; and
when he considered the popularity which the council had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
acquired, in consequence of the general persuasion of the
Christian world, that its deliberations would tend to the
benefit of the church, his breast was agitated by a sense
of the danger which he incurred in counteracting its
operations. Poggio entered with dutiful zeal into the
feelings of his patron, and resolved to attempt, by friendly
admonition and remonstrance, to persuade the cardinal
of St. Angelo to withdraw his countenance and support
from the rebellious ecclesiastics of Basil. With this view
he addressed to him an elaborate letter, in which he entreated
him to consider, that though in summoning the
council he was actuated by the most upright intentions,
and by a sincere desire to promote the good of the church,
yet he was in duty bound to believe, that the pope was
influenced by the same motives in the formation of his
opinion, that such an assembly was inexpedient and dangerous.
He reminded him, that he was by no means
authorized to set up his private sentiments in opposition
to the decision of the head of the church. He further
observed, that they who began the reformation so loudly
demanded, by manifesting their contempt of the pontifical
dignity, were the most dangerous partizans and
promoters of heresy. He then proceeded solemnly to
forewarn his friend, that if he persisted in his determination,
he would forfeit his peace of mind for ever; for he
would have the mortification of seeing the plans which
he had meditated for the benefit of the church converted
into the means of her destruction. After assuring him
that the council was likely to become subservient to the
ambition of one sovereign prince, and to the hatred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
which another had conceived against Eugenius, who was
already doomed to deposition—he thus proceeded—“You
will perhaps say, I know nothing of the intentions of
others; but as to myself, I am conscious that I am
prompted by zeal for the promotion of the general
good; and whatever may be the consequences of the
measures which I adopt, the rectitude of my intentions
will secure me from blame. But take care, my good
friend, lest you be led astray. I know that your intentions
are excellent: but I also know that you cannot
answer for the integrity of your associates. Affairs
may issue in a manner directly contrary to your expectations.
It is a most difficult task to curb resentment,
hatred, and avarice; and it is very certain that
men are corrupted by being freed from salutary restraints.
When you take into consideration the different
views by which mankind are actuated, the hopes
of the public benefit which you expect to derive from
this council should not render you insensible of the
danger with which it is attended. You ought therefore
to dread incurring a weight of responsibility by obstinately
persevering in your own opinion. In explaining
to the pontiff the reasons which convince you of the
expediency of summoning a council, you have acted as
becomes a virtuous and prudent man. His holiness is,
however, of opinion, that the present is not a proper
time for the holding of such an assembly.—Do you think
it right to maintain your sentiments by arms and violence?
Plato says that we ought not bear arms against
our native country or our parents—And who is more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
truly our parent than the earthly representative of our
Father in Heaven; and what country is more dear
to us than the church in which we are saved? You
and the pontiff are aiming at the same end, but by
different means—Which of you ought to give way to
the other? Consider, I entreat you, the dispositions
and views of those who countenance this assembly, and
you will be convinced that they entertain the most pernicious
designs. If you do not recede, you will inflict
upon the church a wound, which, however you may wish,
you will be unable to heal.”<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>The doctrine of passive obedience may be seriously
maintained by those who bask in the sunshine of princely
favour, and by those who are pleased or satisfied with the
conduct of the powers that be; for men feel no disposition
to resist measures which operate to their own advantage, or
which they themselves approve. But when they are required
to do that which is subversive of their interests, or repugnant
to their feelings, they generally find reasons, to themselves
at least satisfactory, for opposing the dictates even of
long established authority. So it was with the cardinal of
St. Angelo. Dazzled by the splendours which beamed
around the presidential throne, he could not see the cogency
of the reasons which urged him to forego his newly acquired
honours; and the arguments of Poggio had no influence
upon his conduct. On the contrary, he deemed it strictly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
compatible with his duty to the common father of the faithful
still to preside in the rebellious synod, which on the
eleventh day of September again met in solemn assembly.
[A. D. 1433.] In this session, the procurators of the council,
after representing, that notwithstanding the lenity which
had been exercised towards Eugenius, in deferring the process
which his obstinacy justly merited, the pontiff still
refused to submit to the ordinances of the august representatives
of the Christian church, demanded, that without any
delay, he should be put upon his trial, as being impeached
of contumacious opposition to the exercise of legitimate
authority. To this demand the archbishop of Spoleto and
the bishop of Cervi, in the name of Eugenius, made certain
frivolous objections, which were immediately over-ruled.
The pontifical deputies were then informed by the president,
that if they were prepared to announce the determination of
their master to comply with the requisitions of the assembly
in whose presence they stood, this welcome intelligence
would be received with the utmost joy—but that if they
were not authorised so to do, they might rest assured, that
the members of the council would prefer death to the
adoption of any measures which were likely to endanger
the church of Christ. The envoys of Eugenius not being
authorised to make the required concessions, withdrew
from the assembly, and it was expected that a legal
process would have been instantly commenced against their
refractory constituent.</p>

<p>In this crisis Eugenius was sheltered from the threatened
storm by the friendship of the emperor Sigismund.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
Towards the latter end of the year 1431, that monarch
had come into Italy with the intention of receiving the
imperial crown from the hands of the pope.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> Eugenius,
however, taking umbrage at his intimate connexion with
the duke of Milan, whom he regarded as a secret enemy
to himself, and the avowed foe of his country, refused to
permit him to visit Rome.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> The emperor being thus
frustrated in the attainment of the object of his journey
across the Alps, quitted Milan, and after visiting Piacenza,
Parma, and Lucca, at length went to Siena, where he
fixed his abode for the space of several months. During
his residence in this city he carried on a negociation with
the pontiff, in the course of which he found means to
calm the jealous apprehensions of Eugenius, who at length
consented to admit the imperial petitioner into his capital.
Sigismund accordingly made his triumphant entry into
Rome, where he was received on the twenty-first of May,
1433, by the acclamations of the populace; and on the
thirty-first of the same month he was crowned with all due
solemnity in the church of the Vatican.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> The festivity
which occurred on this occasion was increased by the joy
diffused throughout Italy, on account of the termination
of the war between the duke of Milan and the Florentines,
who had been induced, by the mediation of the marquis of
Este, to sign a treaty of peace at Ferrara about three
weeks before Sigismund’s arrival in Rome.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> During the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
emperor’s residence in that city, he experienced from
Eugenius the respectful hospitality which was due to his
exalted rank and the excellence of his character.<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> In
return for the kindness of the pontiff, he determined to
promote his interests by moderating the violence of the
council. He accordingly sent by his ambassadors a letter
to that assembly, in which, after recounting the good
services which he had rendered to the council of Constance,
which, he observed, bore sufficient testimony of the zeal
which he felt for the good of the church, he requested that
the term appointed for the probation of Eugenius might
be further prolonged for the space of thirty days. With
this request the council immediately complied, and issued
a decree accordingly.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> Soon after the promulgation of this
decree, the emperor arrived in Basil, and his influence was
speedily visible, in the additional lenity shewn to the pontiff,
by the prorogation of further proceedings against him
for the space of ninety days, from the sixth of November,
1433, on which day Sigismund assisted in person at the
sitting of the council, adorned with all the insignia of
imperial authority.</p>

<p>Whilst Sigismund was thus exerting his influence to
avert from Eugenius the evil consequences of his stern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
refusal to concur in any act derogatory to the prerogatives
of the sovereign pontificate, the proceedings of the council
afforded the enemies of the pontiff a pretext to gratify their
ambition and revenge, by the invasion of his territories. It
has been before observed, that in the course of the late war
which the duke of Milan had waged with various success
against the Florentines, that prince had been greatly irritated
by the support given to his adversaries by the pontiff,
on whom he determined to signalize his vengeance whenever
a convenient opportunity should present itself. When,
therefore, the council of Basil had decreed, that the refusal
of the pontiff to concur in its measures should render
him liable to the penalty of suspension from all pontifical
functions whatsoever, the duke aided and abetted Francesco
Sforza, who, under pretence of enforcing the decrees
of the council, made an irruption into the states of the
church, and took possession of Jesi, Monte d’Olmo, Osimo,
Ascoli, and Ancona. At the same time, the very
centre of the ecclesiastical territories was invested by three
noted Condottieri, Taliano, Furlano, Antonello da Siena,
and Jacopo da Lunato, who, also professing to act on behalf
of the council, invaded the duchy of Spoleto. Nor did
the difficulties of Eugenius end here; for he now found by
sad experience, that he who in the hour of prosperity injures
a benefactor, may in the season of adversity find
that benefactor in the number of his most implacable enemies.
His territories were harrassed by the able warrior
Niccolò Fortebraccio, who had formerly commanded the
pontifical troops with great courage and fidelity, and had
reduced under the ecclesiastical dominion the towns of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
Vetralla and Civita Vecchia; but when he demanded the
recompense to which he justly imagined himself entitled,
had indignantly received for answer, that the booty which
he had taken in the expedition in which he had been engaged
was an ample remuneration for his services. Poggio,
who regarded his native country with that proud partiality
which has always been a striking feature in the
character of the Italians, was greatly chagrined when he
saw the dominions of the pontiff laid waste by a war, the
flames of which were kindled by a convention of Germans.
His attachment to his master also filled him with the deepest
concern, when he beheld the difficulties and dangers to
which Eugenius was exposed by the incursions of his enemies.
His sense of the pontiff’s misfortunes was the more
acute, as he was well aware, that the comforts and emoluments
of the officers of the pontifical household were liable
to be materially diminished by the interruption of business,
and the defalcation of the papal revenues, which must be
the inevitable consequence of the present disturbances.
Recollecting the disagreeable situation in which he had been
formerly placed by the deposition of John XXII., he was
fearful lest the council of Basil should dethrone his present
lord, by which circumstance he would be reduced to the
disgraceful alternative of either quitting the line of preferment,
in which he had fixed all his hopes of future subsistence,
or of adhering to the fortunes of a master, whose
embarrassments would deprive him of the means of giving
his servants a remuneration at all adequate either to their
merits, or to their necessities. Full of these gloomy presages,
he determined once more to address himself to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
cardinal of St. Angelo, whom he regarded as at least the
innocent author of the calamities which affected every considerate
mind with sorrow. He accordingly transmitted to
him the following letter, in which, wisely forbearing to reproach
his friend for his past conduct, or to enforce with
importunate energy the necessity of adopting new measures,
he gave him such an account of the state of Italy,
and of his own feelings, as was well calculated to make an
impression upon his heart.</p>

<p>“Being some time ago alarmed by the prospect of
impending calamity, and clearly foreseeing the tempests
which have now begun to rage with the utmost violence, I
detailed my apprehensions in a letter which I intended,
most reverend father, to have addressed to you. That
letter, which the nature of its subject caused to be extended
to an extraordinary length, I did not send to
you, according to my original design—not through
fear of exciting your displeasure (for I know you too
well to entertain any apprehensions on that subject)
but through dread of giving offence to others. For
though I am conscious that I was prompted to write
merely by a wish to promote the public good, I
was apprehensive lest my motives should be misconstrued,
and lest it should be thought that my letter was dictated
by flattery. You, however, and many other respectable
characters, can bear witness, that flattery is not by any
means among the number of my failings, and that
neither a love of reputation, nor a regard for my own
interest, ever induces me to prostitute my opinions, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
to approve in words, what I disapprove in my heart.
On some occasions indeed I have been materially injured
by the freedom with which I am accustomed to speak my
sentiments. But sensible as I was, that the dissensions
of the powerful are always dangerous, and that the
dissensions of ecclesiastics are attended with peculiar
peril, inasmuch as they involve the hazard of immortal
souls; having also frequently read and heard, that
trifling disagreements have been inflamed into the
greatest animosity and strife, to the utter ruin of states
and empires, I was afraid lest this new contention
amongst the chiefs of the sacerdotal order, should
involve the Christian world in difficulties, which neither
you nor your associates, whatever might be your inclination,
would be able to obviate. When we are called
to the task of deliberation, we may forbear to act if we
please. But when we have begun to act, fortune, the
arbitress of human affairs, directs the event; and directs
it rather according to the dictates of her caprice, as
Sallust observes, than according to the principles of
reason. When you have once put yourself in motion,
you cannot stop when you please. In perilous seasons
it is the duty of the wise to try to preserve the ship by
retaining it in the harbour. When you have committed
yourself to the winds, you are compelled to obey their
impulse. In these circumstances the most skilful pilot
may suffer shipwreck, or at least, despairing of making
any effectual resistance against the fury of the gale, he
may be carried into regions far distant from those to
which it was his wish to steer his course. When I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
reflected on these topics, I was in a manner irresistibly
impelled, by my affection for our common country, to
acquaint you with my sentiments. After having resided
for so many years in the Roman court, I was grieved to
see our affairs reduced to such a state, that we had every
thing to fear, and but little to hope. In these circumstances
I had no consolation for my sorrow: for I have
not, like others, been so intent upon amassing riches,
as to be able to lose my sense of the public calamity in
the contemplation of my private prosperity. I could wish
to be numbered amongst those</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“Whose walls now rise, who rest in soft repose.”</div>
  </div>

</div>

<p>“Though I am sensibly affected by the distresses of
our church, yet I must confess, that if my own fortunes
were not involved in the common danger, I should feel
little compassion for those who have brought mischief
upon their own heads, by the obstinate folly of their
councils. But I am now distressed by a double grief.
For as I have two countries, namely, the land of my
nativity and the Roman court, the theatre of my industrious
exertions, the ruin of the latter, which seems to be
fast approaching, cannot but bring calamity upon the
former. And certainly, matters are now brought to such
an extremity, that human wisdom seems incompetent to
the healing of the evil. A fire is kindled, which nothing
but the most extensive ruin can extinguish. Much better
would it have been that this unfortunate council had
never assembled, than that it should have occasioned the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
devastation of Italy. We daily behold the fortresses and
towns of this unhappy country plundered by a lawless
soldiery.—Slaughter, fire, rapine, the violation of helpless
females, swell the catalogue of her woes. Great occasion
have we to lament, that the Holy Spirit (if indeed
it now deigns to dwell amongst us) has changed its nature,
and instead of being the author of peace and concord, is
become the exciter of hatred and malevolence. Some
people have entertained an opinion, that Italy has too
long enjoyed the blessings of tranquillity, and they have
supplied the ambitious with the means of disturbing the
public peace. By this conduct they attempt to cure a
slight indisposition by the introduction of a dangerous
disease. For though it may be justly said, that the
ecclesiastical body was in some respects out of order, the
complaint was not of so serious a nature as to require the
application of such violent remedies as are now resorted
to. It can never be the part of wisdom to correct one
error by the commission of a greater. But let us submit
the issues of things to the direction of Providence. One
thing I foresee, that some nations will derive advantage
from our ruin, whilst others will share our afflictions. But
I am not anxious about the destiny of other countries.
I mourn over the calamities which I am well aware will be
brought upon Italy by the oppression which we endure,
and by the ambition of a prince who wishes to reign
according to the dictates of his own arbitrary will. You
must remember that I prophesied, that these evils would
flow from the convocation of the council; and I have
resolved to address you once more on this subject, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
order to assure you that I was not prompted by resentment
thus to communicate my opinion, and to prognosticate
impending mischiefs. I beg that you will not be displeased
either by my former, or by my present letter. If your
conscience acquits you, regard my remarks as referring to
others, and not to yourself. If you have inadvertently
fallen into error, you ought to be grateful to him, who
in the honest language of admonition, lays before you
his own sentiments, or the opinions of the world at large
concerning the nature of your conduct. For though
your virtue has raised you to the highest degree of dignity,
yet I know that you are but a man, that many
circumstances escape your observation, that various
matters elude your inquiries, and in short, that it is
impossible for you to attain to universal or infallible
knowledge.”<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>It does not appear that this attempt of Poggio to induce
the cardinal of St. Angelo to adopt the views of the
Roman court was productive of any benefit either to himself
or the pontiff. Eugenius, indeed, finding himself involved
in the greatest difficulties, had determined to yield
to necessity, and acknowledge the legality of the council.
He accordingly commissioned the archbishop of Taranto,
and the bishop of Cervi, to present to the assembled fathers
a letter, in which he declared, that whereas great dissensions
had arisen in consequence of his having dissolved the council<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
then sitting at Basil, he was willing to testify his regard
for the church by confirming the proceedings of that assembly,
which he acknowledged to have been legally held and
continued; unreservedly revoking the bulls by which its
proceedings had been condemned, and professing that he
would henceforth cease from doing any thing to the prejudice
of the council, or of any of its adherents.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> This
letter, which was publicly read in the cathedral of Basil on
the 5th of February 1434, gave considerable satisfaction to
the friends of reformation and peace, who hoped that the
happiest consequences would result from this union of the
head and the principal members of the ecclesiastical body.—Together
with his conciliatory epistle, Eugenius sent a
commission, empowering several eminent dignitaries of the
church to act as his representatives, and in his name to
preside at the debates of the council. Such, however, was
the jealousy with which the proceedings of the pontiff were
observed, that before these deputies were permitted in their
official capacity to take any part in the deliberations of the
council, they were compelled to take an oath, whereby they
bound themselves to maintain all the ordinances of that
assembly, and particularly that decree which asserted, that
the authority of a general council is paramount to that of the
pope.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>Though by these acts of concession Eugenius appeared
to have made his peace with the council, his dominions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
continued to feel the scourge of war. The freebooters by
whom they were infested, in fact despised the debates of
churchmen; and though they pretended that they invaded
the ecclesiastical states in order to compel Eugenius to submit
to the power of the council, they did not manifest any
disposition to withdraw their forces when the pretended
object of their expedition was accomplished. In these circumstances
Eugenius endeavoured to diminish the number
of his foes by soliciting Sforza to agree to terms of pacification.
In this instance his efforts were crowned with the
desired success. Sforza, on condition of his being appointed
to the government of the Marca d’Ancona, with the title
of apostolic vicar and gonfaloniere of the Roman church,
not only consented to abstain from further hostilities
against his holiness, but promised to defend the pontiff
from the attacks of his other enemies. In pursuance of
this promise, he turned his arms against Fortebraccio,
whom he fought and defeated near Tivoli. The duke of
Milan was greatly displeased by the change which had so
suddenly taken place in the politics of Sforza; and still
persisting in his determination to harrass the pontiff, he
excited Niccolò Piccinino to attempt the conquest of his
native city Perugia. Piccinino marching into Romagna
with this intention, kept Sforza in check, and thus favoured
the operations of Fortebraccio. The latter chieftain
having received a reinforcement of troops from Viterbo,
pushed his light cavalry to the very gates of Rome. On
the approach of his forces, the faction of the Colonnas,
who, though not openly, yet deeply resented the cruelty
with which their chiefs had been treated at the commencement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
of Eugenius’s pontificate, and had long been waiting
for an opportunity of taking vengeance on their adversaries,
flew to arms, exhorting the populace to assert their liberty.
[May 29th, A. D. 1433.] The insurrection soon became
general, and the rebellious Romans, not contented with
imprisoning Francesco Condolmieri, the nephew of Eugenius,
surrounded with guards the residence of the pontiff
himself. Eugenius, however, disguising himself in the
habit of a monk, had the good fortune to elude their
vigilance; [June 5th] and, attended by two only of his
domestics, threw himself into a small bark, with an
intention of taking refuge in Ostia. But he had not
proceeded far down the Tyber, before he was recognised
by the populace, who, crowding to the banks of the river,
almost overwhelmed him with a shower of stones and
arrows. So fierce was their attack, that it was not without
considerable difficulty that the fugitive pontiff effected his
escape, and retired, first to Leghorn, and afterwards to
Florence.<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>On this occasion the officers of the pontifical household
were dispersed, each providing for his own safety
according to the dictates of his prudence, or his fear.
The greater number of them, embarking in some small
coasting vessels, set sail for Pisa; but were met in the
course of their voyage by some Corsican pirates, who plundered
them of all their property. Others, attempting to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
proceed to Florence by land, were exposed to various
vexations. Poggio had the misfortune to fall into the
hands of the soldiers of Piccinino, who detained him in
captivity, in the expectation of extorting from him a considerable
sum of money, by way of ransom.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> When the
intelligence of this event reached the Tuscan territory,
it excited the deep concern of all his acquaintance, and
particularly of Ambrogio Traversari, who, without delay,
earnestly solicited Francesco, count of Poppio, to exert
all his influence to procure his liberation.</p>

<p>“Since I wrote to you,” says he in his letter to the
count, “I have received information that my most intimate
friend, the dear associate of my studies, Poggio,
the papal secretary, is detained in captivity by the magnificent
lord and excellent captain Niccolò Piccinino.
Believe me this intelligence is very painful to my
feelings—but the concern which I experience is much
alleviated by the opinion which I have long entertained
of your humanity, and which induces me to hope that
I shall not make a request to you in vain.—I beg and
beseech you therefore, my lord, to use all diligence to
effect the liberation of one whom you know to be most
dear to me. I presume that the illustrious chieftain, at
whose disposal he now is, can deny you nothing, especially
when you make a reasonable request on behalf of a
friend. I should be more diffuse in my petition did I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
think it were needful, and were I not assured, that fewer
words than those which I have already written will be
sufficient to induce Piccinino to restore so learned and
so liberally minded a man as Poggio to liberty.”<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>The endeavours of Ambrogio to procure the gratuitous
release of Poggio were ineffectual. The rugged soldiers
who detained the learned secretary in captivity, had no
sympathy with the feelings of friendship. They respected
not the accomplishments of the scholar; and in all probability
their observation of the esteem in which their
prisoner was held by his friends, served only to enhance the
price which they demanded for his liberation. Finding that
he had no other means of deliverance, Poggio purchased
his freedom at the expense of a sum of money, which the
narrowness of his circumstances rendered it very inconvenient
for him to pay; and immediately on his enlargement,
he continued his route to Florence.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

</div>

<p>At almost any other period than that of the flight of
Eugenius from Rome, the dangers and inconveniences to
which Poggio was exposed in following the fortunes of his
master, would have been in a great measure counterbalanced
by the opportunity which the translation of the pontifical
court to Florence afforded him of revisiting the scene of
his youthful studies. He was accustomed to regard the
Tuscan capital as a sure refuge in the season of calamity,
as a hospitable retreat, where, whenever he was oppressed
by adverse fortune, he might sooth his cares to rest in the
bosom of friendship. But how frequently do events demonstrate
the fallaciousness of human expectations! When
at the termination of his journey, the stately towers of
Florence rose to the view of Poggio, he experienced a
sentiment of deep dejection, in reflecting, that amongst
the friends whose eagerness to congratulate him on his safe
arrival, he anticipated, in pleasing imagination, he should
not now behold his illustrious protector, Cosmo de Medici,
whom the intrigues of faction had lately banished from his
native land. This celebrated man had inherited from his
ancestors a considerable property, which he had improved
by his own industry and skill in mercantile affairs. In
popular governments, riches, if they are diffused with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
liberal hand, generally become the means of acquiring
power; and if the possessor of wealth unite with generosity
the discernment of prudence and the graces of urbanity, he
almost infallibly secures to himself the permanent favour
of the people. To Cosmo, therefore, in whose character
these virtues met in happy conjunction, the Florentine
populace looked up with sentiments of enthusiastic admiration.
Examining the history of his native city with the
eye of a statesman, and meditating upon the civic revolutions
which he himself had witnessed, that sagacious
politician had observed, that in the contentions for power
which had frequently taken place between the aristocracy
and the lower orders of the state, the plebeian faction had
almost always failed, through want of a leader whose
authority might restrain their irregularities, and whose
judgment might give to their efforts the consistency and
energy of system. In order to supply this deficiency, he
placed himself at the head of the popular party, presuming
no doubt, that whilst he exercised his splendid talents for
the benefit of his adherents, he could at the same time
make use of the favour of the people to promote his own
emolument and glory.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> Acting with these views, he soon
gained a degree of ascendency in the republic, which
enabled him to embarrass the measures of the aristocracy.
Cosmo now found by experience, that he who engages in civil
dissensions embarks on a sea of troubles. The chiefs of
the opposite party regarded him with that hatred, which the
privileged orders usually entertain against those who attempt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
to restrain their ambition and diminish their power. At the
head of the nobility was Rinaldo degli Albizzi, who watched
the proceedings of Cosmo with all the vigilance of factious
jealousy, and resolved to seize the earliest opportunity
to effect his destruction. With this view Rinaldo procured
the appointment of Bernardo Guadagni, a declared enemy
to popular rights, to the office of gonfaloniere, or chief
magistrate of the republic. No sooner was Guadagni invested
with his new honours, than he made the requisite
preparations to subdue the faction of the people. At this
time Cosmo was at his country seat at Mugello, a pleasant
valley, situated at a small distance from Florence,<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> whither
he had withdrawn, in order to avoid the confusion of civil
discord; but the proceedings of Guadagni could not be concealed
from his partizans, who immediately sent messengers
to inform him that his adversaries were meditating some enterprise
of a hostile nature. On the receipt of this intelligence
Cosmo repaired to Florence, and waiting on some of the
chief magistrates whom he regarded as his personal friends,
he represented to them the reasons which he had to be
alarmed for his safety. Being either ignorant of the designs
of Rinaldo, or eager to secure their victim by the base
artifices of treachery, these men assured him that he had
nothing to fear; and in order to lull his apprehensions to
sleep, nominated him as one of a council of eight, by whose
advice, as they said, they wished to be guided in the government<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
of the state.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> Cosmo put so much confidence in these
demonstrations of friendship, that he readily obeyed a
summons which he soon afterwards received, requiring him
to attend at a council which was to be held on the seventh
of September, 1433, to deliberate upon the best method of
securing the tranquillity of the republic. He was no sooner
arrived at the palace, than the square in front of that edifice
was lined with armed men, commanded by Rinaldo and the
other chiefs of the aristocracy. Under the control of this
guard the people were summoned to elect two hundred
deputies, to whom was to be delegated the important business
of deciding upon the reforms which were necessary in
the administration of public affairs. These deputies were
no sooner chosen, than their attention was directed to Cosmo
by his enemies, some of whom loudly demanded his
death, as necessary to the preservation of the public tranquillity;
whilst others, more moderate in their views, and
more merciful in their dispositions, insisted upon it, that
this desirable end would be effectually accomplished, by
banishing him to a distance from the territories of the republic.
During this awful deliberation, Cosmo was detained
a prisoner in the palace, from the windows of which, whilst
he anxiously endeavoured, by watching the gestures of his
judges, to prognosticate his fate, he heard the din of arms,
and observed the movements of the troops. The fear of
some of the deputies, and the secret attachment of others
to the person of Cosmo, preventing the assembly from
coming to any immediate determination of his destiny, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
was for the present committed to the custody of Federigo
Malavolti. Finding himself thus in the power of his
enemies, and understanding that they had not been able to
prevail on the deputies to decree his death, he was apprehensive
that they would attempt to take him off by poison.
Powerfully impressed by this idea, for the space of four
days he declined taking any food, except a small portion of
bread. The pride of Federigo was offended by this suspicion
of his prisoner, whom he is said to have addressed in
the following terms:—“Through fear of dying by poison,
Cosmo, you are destroying yourself by famine. And
have you so little reliance on my honour as to think that I
would be accessary to such villainy? So numerous are
your friends, that I do not think your life is in any danger;
but should your destruction be determined upon,
rest assured, that your adversaries will find other means
than my assistance to effect their purpose. I would not
imbrue my hands in any one’s blood, much less in yours,
who have never offended me. Be of good courage—take
your food, and live for your friends and your
country; and that you may take your repast in full confidence,
I will partake of whatsoever you eat.” Overcome
by this manly address, Cosmo, with tears in his eyes,
embraced his keeper, and vowed, that if fortune should
ever put it in his power, he would testify his grateful sense
of his kindness.</p>

<p>When the adherents of Cosmo were informed of his
imprisonment, they took up arms with a determination to
effect his deliverance: but by the direction of his particular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
friends, who were justly apprehensive that Rinaldo would
be provoked by any hostile attempt on their part to signalize
his vengeance by the murder of his prisoner, they retired
without accomplishing any thing in his favour. When
the news of the arrest of Cosmo reached Venice, the seigniory
of that republic took such a lively interest in his fate,
that they sent to Florence three ambassadors, who were
instructed to exert all their influence in his favour. At last
these plenipotentiaries could obtain from the Florentine
magistracy nothing more than an assurance that the person of
Cosmo should be safe. When he was at length sentenced
to be banished to Padua for ten years, they requested from
the magistrates that during the term of his exile he might
be permitted to reside in their city. The petition of the
Venetians was granted; but the triumphant nobles still
detained Cosmo in custody as an hostage, to secure the
acquiescence of his partizans in the new measures which
they intended to adopt for the regulation of the state.
They were also prompted to protract his imprisonment by
the malicious hope, that the hazardous nature of his situation
would injure his commercial credit. When Cosmo
found himself thus unexpectedly detained, with the connivance
of his keeper he sent a message to his friends,
directing them to purchase the favour of Guadagni by the
timely application of a sum of money. Influenced by this
powerful motive, the mercenary chief magistrate, on the
night of the third of October, liberated his prisoner from
custody, and conducting him through one of the city gates,
suffered him without further molestation to proceed on his
route to Padua, from whence he proceeded to Venice. On his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
arrival at the latter city, the illustrious exile was met by the
principal citizens, who received him with every mark of
honour and respect; and he had not long resided there,
before the administrators of the Tuscan government were
persuaded, by the reiterated instances of the seigniory,
to enlarge the sphere of his liberty to the full extent of
the territories of the Venetian republic.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>In the days of his prosperity, Cosmo had been distinguished
as the munificent patron of learned men. To them
his doors were constantly open; and his purse was always
ready to assist their efforts to promote the diffusion of
literature. Poggio had long enjoyed the happiness of
being honoured by his particular favour. The pleasing
interchange of beneficence and gratitude, which had at an
early period taken place between the learned secretary and
the princely merchant of Florence, had been matured
into the intimacy of the most cordial friendship. Poggio
was not one of those sycophants who reserve their homage
for the prosperous; and who, with the base foresight which
is too frequently dignified with the name of prudence,
studiously disengage themselves from the fortunes of a
falling family. When he received information that his
benefactor had been obliged to yield to the fury of his
enemies, he experienced all the emotions of affectionate
sympathy; and hastened to testify his undiminished regard
for his persecuted friend in the following consolatory epistle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span></p>

<p>“Though the serious misfortune in which you are
involved is too great to be alleviated by consolation,
especially by such consolation as can be administered
by one of my moderate abilities—yet, following the
dictates of my affection for you, I had rather run the
hazard of exposing the feebleness of my genius, than
fail in the duty of friendship. It is said that trifling
circumstances sometimes produce considerable effects in
affairs of the greatest moment; and I may be permitted
to indulge the hope, that this epistle may tend, in some
small degree, to lighten the weight of your affliction.
You have experienced the capriciousness of fortune, (for
this goddess we may blame with impunity) and you
are fallen from a station of considerable eminence.
Now, though I have always observed that you are
endowed with a strength of mind which enables you to
regard with indifference afflictions which would overwhelm
the generality of men, yet when I consider the
magnitude of your misfortunes, I cannot but be apprehensive
of the effect which they may have upon your
feelings. If in your present circumstances you rise
in the confidence of courage, superior to the assaults of
fortune; if you have placed your independence upon the
security of a pure conscience, rather than upon external
good; and if you value the blessings of the present
life at no higher a rate than is consistent with the dictates
of true wisdom—I congratulate you on the acquisition
of that happy constitution of mind which
renders consolation unnecessary. If, on the other hand,
in consequence of the natural frailty incident to humanity,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
this sudden change in your circumstances has
disturbed the tranquillity of your temper, (and before
this trial the constancy of the most illustrious men has
been found to give way) you must have recourse to
the principles of reason, which will suggest to you, that
you have lost nothing which can be truly called your
own. Dignities, authority, and honours, riches, power,
and health, are liable to be impaired by the shocks of
fortune, and the machinations of our enemies. But
prudence, magnanimity, probity, fortitude, and fidelity,
are qualities which we obtain by our own exertions,
and which we may retain in defiance of external
injury and distress. These virtues you have cultivated
as your firmest defence in the hour of danger;
and whilst you are possessed of this rich endowment,
you should rejoice in the enjoyment of such exquisite
blessings, rather than grieve on account of the wrongs
which you suffer from your foes. I am well assured,
that you are not of the number of those who fix their
hopes of happiness on the kindness of fortune. For,
notwithstanding the ample possessions, and the exalted
honours which you have formerly attained, (possessions
and honours superior to any which have fallen to
the lot of any other citizen of our state) you have
always made it your study to acquire those good qualities
of the heart, which render a man independent of
externals. In public affairs, uniting prudence in deliberation,
with ability in execution, you have always
acted with such good faith and integrity, that you
reserved for yourself nothing, save honour and glory.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
Would all men follow so worthy an example, our
republic would enjoy much greater tranquillity than falls
to her lot at present. You have given the most ample
proof of your dutifulness to your native country, of
liberality to your friends, and benevolence to all men.
You have been the support of the needy, the refuge of
the oppressed, the patron and friend of the learned.
You have used the gifts of fortune with such moderation,
modesty, and kindness, that they appeared to be nothing
more than the due reward paid to your virtue and merits.
I forbear to dwell upon the literary pursuits in which
you have been engaged from the days of your youth,
and in which you have made such progress, that you are
justly deemed an ornament and an honour to learning.
When the important affairs of a public nature, by which
your time has of late years been occupied, prevented
you from dedicating to study as much time as you
wished to have appropriated to that pursuit, you sought
instruction and gratification in the conversation of
learned men, whom you invited to partake of the hospitality
of your house. From these eminent scholars
you imbibed the precepts of wisdom, which you resolved
to adopt as the rule of your conduct in all circumstances
and situations.</p>

<p>“The consciousness of innocence, and the remembrance
of virtuous deeds, is the greatest source of consolation
in adversity. He who can appeal to his own
heart in proof of the uprightness of his intentions—he
who can truly say that he has acted honourably both<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
in his public and private capacity, that he has always
studied the promotion of the general good, that he has
assisted his friends with wholesome advice, and the poor
with money; that he has hurt no one, not even those
who had injured him—this man must be well prepared
to endure the shock of adversity. A course of conduct,
regulated by these principles, confers true and solid
dignity. On this foundation you have established your
character as a worthy man and an excellent citizen.
Acting on these principles, you have risen to immortal
glory. Wherever you go, that best of blessings, the
testimony of a good conscience, will attend you; and
the memory of your virtues will survive when you are
laid in the grave.</p>

<p>“Now, since the retrospect of your past conduct
affords you such a pure delight, you ought to feel yourself
elated by conscious dignity: for on what can we
justly pride ourselves, except on the reputation which
we have acquired by our virtues? Since, then, you
have so strong a fortress, in which you can take refuge
in time of trouble, turn your attention to those things
which accompany you in your exile, namely, your liberality,
your prudence, your gravity, your upright intentions,
your discernment, your attachment to your native
country, for which you have always testified the utmost
affection; and especially in the late civil broils to which
you have fallen a victim. I need not remind you of
your literary pursuits, which so signally contribute to the
alleviation of sorrow, and to the strengthening of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
mind by the examples and precepts of the most worthy
men. For you know that philosophers of old have
maintained, that the mind of the wise man is beyond
the reach of the impulses of fortune, and that it mocks
the efforts of external violence—that virtue is the chief
good—and that all other possessions are blessings, or
the contrary, according to the disposition of the possessor.
But I do not require that you should be of the
number of those faultless friends of wisdom, who have,
perhaps, never existed, excepting in idea. I only hope
that you will be found worthy to class with those, who,
according to common acceptation, and the general course
of human conduct, are reputed wise.</p>

<p>“And, in the first place, consider how far fortune has
exercised her tyranny in your case. For, if you could
divest yourself of the first impressions of grief, and coolly
consider what she has taken away, and what she has left,
you will find that you have sustained little injury—nay,
that you have derived benefit from her caprice. She has
banished you from your native country, which you have
often voluntarily quitted—but she has restored to you
your liberty, which you did not enjoy when you seemed
to be the freest man in the state. She has deprived you
of a certain specious appearance of dignity, and of the
respect of the vulgar, who are always mistaken in their
estimate of true felicity—but she has left you your
children, your wife, your riches, your good health, and
your excellent brother: and, surely, the pleasures which
these blessings bestow upon you ought far to outweigh the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
mortification which you experience in consequence of
your losses. She has taken away from you a kind of
civic pomp, and a popularity full of trouble, labour,
envy, anxiety, and continual cares. These honours
many men eminent for their prudence have despised.
Their loss may be a matter of sorrow to those who have
endeavoured to convert them into a source of gain; but
you, whom they involved in so much labour and difficulty,
ought not to be concerned at being deprived of
them, especially as they never were the objects of your
desire or ambition. For you did not enter upon public
offices with a view of promoting your own interest,
or of increasing your importance, but with an ardent
desire of doing good to the public. Fortune has restored
you to real liberty. You were formerly, in fact,
a mere slave. You could not follow your own inclinations,
either in sleeping or waking, in eating or in
taking exercise. Frequently were you prevented, by
the imperious claims of public business, from assisting
your friends, and indulging in the delights of retirement.
Your time was at the disposal of others, and
you were obliged to attend to every person’s sentiments.
Many favours you were compelled to grant, in direct
opposition to your own wishes, nay, even in opposition
to the dictates of equity; and you were frequently reduced
to the disagreeable necessity of practising the
art of dissimulation. This change of fortune has,
however, set you at liberty, for it has certainly restored
to you the freedom of your will. It has also enabled
you to put to the test the constancy of those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
who professed themselves your friends; and it has,
moreover, called into exercise the steady fortitude of your
soul. All your acquaintance had seen with how great
politeness, gentleness, clemency, equity, and moderation,
you conducted yourself in the season of prosperity—a
season in which men who have attained to some eminence
in wisdom have frequently been betrayed into evil. This
new species of trial gives you an opportunity of showing
the vigour with which you can struggle against the storms
of adversity. Many can bear prosperity, who shrink
before the impulse of misfortune. Others, who have shone
conspicuously in the season of sorrow, have given way
to the emotions of vanity and pride in the hour of their
exaltation. But you we have beheld neither inflated by
arrogance in prosperity, nor sunk into dejection by adversity.
In either fortune, you have exhibited an example
of the most unruffled equanimity.</p>

<p>“Let the following consideration support you in the
midst of your trials—that you are not the first, and that
you will not be the last man whose services to his country
have been repaid by unmerited exile. History abounds
in instances of excellent men, who have been cruelly
persecuted by their ungrateful fellow citizens. They who
cannot bear the splendour of another’s virtues are unwilling
to look upon it. Envy is commonly the companion of
glory—envy which always torments those who cannot
attain to the eminence of honour; and instigates them
to persecute with slander and malevolence the illustrious
characters whose virtues they are unable to imitate. Hence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
it happens, that very few men of superlative talents escape
the fury of civil tempests. The fear of giving offence
deters me from dwelling upon the instances of this nature,
which have occurred in modern times, and in our own
republic. But whosoever examines the records of antiquity
will find, that the odium excited by civil discord
has occasioned the banishment of a considerable number
of excellent citizens—and that, not in our country alone,
but in other states of the greatest eminence. To say
nothing of the Greeks and Barbarians, the Roman republic,
even at the time when it is represented as having
attained to the highest pitch of glory, was afflicted with
this infirmity. A few examples will be sufficient to
demonstrate the truth of my assertion. Which of his
contemporaries was equal in valour, probity, and illustrious
deeds to Furius Camillus? Yet, in consequence
of the malevolence of the tribunes and the populace, he
was compelled to retire into exile; at a time too when
his country stood very much in need of his assistance.
You well remember the important services rendered to
the Roman commonwealth by Scipio Africanus; you
recollect the moderation, continence, and gravity, which
shone so conspicuously in the life of the illustrious
conqueror of Hannibal—yet he too was driven from his
native country by the rage of the tribunes. The uprightness
and sanctity of P. Rutilius were the very causes of
his banishment. When this man had an opportunity of
returning to his country in consequence of Sylla’s victory,
he had the honest pride to refuse to fix his residence in a
state in which arms were superior to the laws. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
villany of Clodius expelled M. T. Cicero, the saviour of
his country, who is said to have been accustomed to
boast, that he was carried back to Rome on the shoulders
of all Italy. History has recorded the names of several
other renowned men who have shared the same fate: but
I have only mentioned these four, the consideration of
whose destiny may prevent you from being surprised at
your own misfortunes. I shall not pretend to maintain
that you are equal to these exalted characters in fame and
splendour—but this I will say, that, like them, you have
experienced an ungrateful return for your good services
to your fellow citizens; and that in one respect your
glory is not at all inferior to theirs. For, in my opinion,
you deserve to be held in everlasting remembrance for the
deference which you paid to the decree of the magistrates,
though you knew the doom which awaited you. For
when, as it is commonly reported, you could have repelled
the meditated injury by the assistance of your partizans,
and the interference of the populace, you thought it
better to submit to wrong, than to avert it by violence.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>
And as civil tumults never end in good, consulting for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
the quiet of your country, and the tranquillity of your
fellow citizens, you prudently suffered this sudden storm
to waste its fury on yourself and your connections, rather
than endanger the republic by exciting the flame of war.
By this conduct you have attained to the height—I say
not of modern, but of ancient glory. For what is more
laudable than that disposition which prompts a man to
expose himself to the fury of the billows for the sake of
the general safety? Under the influence of that virtue
which prefers public to private good, other states have
flourished, and the Roman republic attained to universal
dominion.</p>

<p>“Protected then as you are by the most illustrious
virtues, you ought not to complain. You ought to be
thankful to fortune, which has called these virtues into
exercise, and has summoned you to a contest, in which
you will gain the highest commendation on earth, and
eternal glory in heaven. These two things are the
objects of the most ardent wishes of good men; for they
are the meed of virtue. During the remainder of your
life, then, enjoy the blessings which you still possess
with a tranquil and peaceful mind; and in whatever land
your lot may be cast, think that your country, the
theatre of your dignity—the spot where you are called
to exert your talents for the promotion of the public
good.”<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span></p>

<p>Such were the counsels by which Poggio endeavoured
to fortify the mind of his banished patron against the
shafts of adverse fortune. His letter breathes the spirit
of enlightened friendship, and his choice of topics of
consolation evinces an accurate knowledge of the human
heart. It may be reasonably conjectured, that Cosmo was
highly gratified by this proof of his sincere attachment,
and that he profited by his good advice. But the administration
of wholesome counsel was not the only mode in
which Poggio, on this occasion, testified his zeal in the
cause of his persecuted benefactor. In the intercourses of
friendship, his temperament disposed him strongly to
sympathize with the resentment of those whom he regarded
with sentiments of esteem and affection. Consequently
the injuries sustained by Cosmo inspired him with the
utmost degree of animosity against the family of the
Albizzi, and all their partizans and abettors. This animosity
against the enemies of his exiled friend, which he took
no pains to disguise, soon involved him in a most violent
quarrel with the celebrated Francesco Filelfo, who had
been induced by the turbulence of his temper, to intermeddle
in the political disputes which had for a long space
of time disturbed the tranquillity of Florence, and to
discharge the venom of his spleen against the house of
Medici and all its adherents.</p>

<p>This extraordinary man was born at Tolentino, on
the twenty-fifth of July, 1398. Having given early indications
of a love of literature, he was sent to prosecute
his studies in the university of Padua. In this seminary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
he made such an uncommon proficiency, that when he
had attained the age of eighteen, he read lectures on
eloquence to numerous audiences. The reputation which
he had acquired by this early display of brilliant talents
procured him an invitation to instruct the noble youth of
Venice in polite literature. This invitation he readily
accepted; and in the discharge of his public duties he
acquitted himself so much to the satisfaction of his
employers, that he was presented with the freedom of the
state. In the course of a little time after his settlement
in Venice, the seigniory testified their sense of his merits
by appointing him to the office of secretary to the embassy
which they usually maintained at Constantinople. This
office he retained for the space of two years, at the end
of which period he entered into the service of the Greek
emperor, John Palæologus, who employed him in affairs
of the greatest consequence. In the character of confidential
agent or envoy of that monarch, he visited the
courts of Amurath II. the Turkish sultan, and of Sigismund,
emperor of Germany. During his residence at
Constantinople he married Theodora, the daughter of a
noble Greek, the celebrated John Crysoloras. In the year
1427 he quitted Constantinople and returned to Venice.
As he had assiduously improved the opportunities which
he had lately enjoyed of cultivating the knowledge of
Grecian literature, he expected, on his return to his
adopted country, to be hailed as the champion of science,
and the restorer of learning.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> But in this expectation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
he was disappointed. His name no longer possessed the
charm of novelty. The interest which was occasioned on
his first visit to Venice, by the circumstance of his filling
the professor’s chair at so early an age, was naturally
weakened by the lapse of nearly eight years; and in all
probability the jealous aristocracy of the Venetian capital
resented his quitting the service of their state for the
honours and emoluments of the Byzantine court. These
causes concurred to render his reception at Venice by no
means flattering to his feelings. The mortification which
he experienced on this occasion was heightened by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
deplorable state of his finances, which the expenses of his
increasing family had reduced to a very low ebb. From
these circumstances of embarrassment he was relieved by
the liberality of the citizens of Bologna, who invited him to
read lectures on eloquence and moral philosophy in their
university; and engaged to requite his services by an
annual stipend of four hundred and fifty gold crowns.
Readily accepting this invitation, he repaired to Bologna
with all convenient speed. Soon after he had entered upon
his new office, that city, which had lately revolted from
Martin V., was doomed to suffer the horrors of a siege, in
consequence of which literary pursuits were entirely suspended.
Thus circumstanced, Filelfo began to feel no small
degree of anxiety, not only concerning the means of his
future support, but also for the safety of himself and his
family. His uneasiness was, however, mitigated by the
receipt of very friendly letters from Niccolo Niccoli and
Pallas Strozza, urging him to quit Bologna, and exercise
his talents for public instruction in Florence.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> After a
negociation of some length, he agreed to give lectures on
the Greek and Roman classics, for the consideration of an
annual salary of three hundred gold crowns, to be paid out
of the revenues of the state. But when he had concluded
this agreement, he experienced very considerable difficulties
in effecting his departure from Bologna, which was
closely invested by the pontifical army. These difficulties
being at length overcome, he hastened to Florence, where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
he was received with every demonstration of respect, and
commenced his labours with the utmost zeal.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> The following
sketch of his first lectures, which is preserved in
the works of Ambrogio Traversari, demonstrates that
in the execution of his engagement he exerted a most
laudable degree of industry. At the dawn of day he explained
and commented upon Cicero’s Tusculan questions,
the first decad of Livy, Cicero’s treatise on Rhetoric, and
Homer’s Iliad. After an interval of a few hours, he delivered
extraordinary lectures on Terence, Cicero’s Epistles
and Orations, Thucydides and Xenophon. In addition
to this laborious course of instruction, he also daily
read a lecture on Morals.<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> Such was the arduous task
undertaken by Filelfo—a task which demanded the exertions
of a literary Hercules. He was, however, animated
to the endurance of toil by the number and dignity of
his audience, which daily consisted of four hundred persons,
many of whom were not less eminent for their
literary acquirements, than for the rank which they held
in the state.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>On Filelfo’s arrival in Florence, he found the inhabitants
of that city divided into factions, and was by no
means insensible of the difficulties which he had to encounter
in endeavouring to avoid being involved in their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
disputes.<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> For the space of two years he seems to have
acted with becoming discretion, and to have pursued his
literary occupations without rendering himself subservient
to the views of either party. His prudence was rewarded
by an increase of his salary, which was augmented, towards
the latter end of the year 1432, to the sum of three
hundred and fifty gold crowns.<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> Unfortunately however
for his peace of mind, he had not resided long at Florence,
before he began to suspect that Niccolo Niccoli and Carlo
Aretino, the latter of whom was one of the most accomplished
of the Tuscan scholars, moved by envy of his
literary fame, regarded him with sentiments of determined
hostility. The irritable temper of Niccolo was indeed
provoked by the supercilious pride of the new Coryphæus,
who, without the least reserve of diffidence, assumed the
high degree of eminence in the scale of importance to
which he deemed himself entitled, and looked down upon
the learned Florentines with undisguised disdain. Well
knowing the intimacy which subsisted between Niccolo
Niccoli and Cosmo de’ Medici, Filelfo took it for granted,
that the latter would adopt the quarrels of his friend, and
consequently apprehended that he had much to dread from
the effects of his resentment. In this apprehension he
was confirmed by the manifest coolness with which he was
treated by Lorenzo, the brother of Cosmo; and he
regarded the assurances which he received from the latter,
that his suspicions with respect to himself were groundless,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
as a refinement of malice, intended to betray him into a
fatal security.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> His dread of the machinations of his
enemies was also increased by a violent attack made upon
him in the streets of Florence, by one Filippo, a noted
assassin, by whom he was severely wounded in the face.<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p>Whilst Filelfo was brooding over his real or imagined
wrongs, a contest arose between the two factions which
divided the city of Florence, in consequence of a quarrel
which had occurred between the houses of Soderini and
Guzano.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> On this occasion he publicly enlisted himself
on the side of the aristocracy, and under the pretext of
honest indignation against injustice, gratified his personal
resentment, by publishing a poetical philippic against the
factious disposition of the Florentine populace, into the
commencement of which he introduced a violent attack
upon the family of the Medici.<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> Not contented with this
act of provocation, he afterwards turned the artillery of
his wrath directly against Cosmo, whom he insulted in a
satire against confidence in riches, in which he attempted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
to disguise the reproaches of malevolence in the garb of
philosophic advice.</p>

<p>The well known liberality of Cosmo’s disposition,
the laudable uses to which he appropriated a considerable
portion of his vast wealth, and the engaging familiarity
with which he was accustomed to converse with people of
merit in every class of life, constituted the most convincing
proof of the malignant falsehood of this libel; and the
adherents of the house of Medici would have done well,
had they treated it with contempt. But thirsting for
revenge, they endeavoured to expel the offending satirist
from the city, by inducing the assembly of the people
considerably to diminish the salaries allowed to the public
instructors maintained by the state. To this defalcation of
their revenues, the other professors patiently submitted;
but Filelfo appealed to the senate, and by the power of his
eloquence persuaded that body to restore their literary
servants to their former footing in point of emolument.
He had also the good fortune to procure the abrogation
of a second ordinance obtained by his enemies, whereby
the whole of the sums annually granted for the support
of public education were marked as objects of retrenchment.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p>Irritated by these hostile measures, Filelfo declared
open war against Cosmo and his friends. He poured forth
a torrent of invective in a series of satires, in which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
severity of Juvenal, and his nauseous delineations of
atrocious vices, are much more successfully imitated than
the sublimity of his moral precepts, or the dignity of his
style. The bitterness of Filelfo’s wrath was particularly
directed against Niccolo Niccoli, whom, sometimes under
the contemptuous appellation of Utis, and sometimes under
the fanciful designation of Lycolaus, he charged with envy
of the learned—hatred of the virtuous—extravagant anger—infidelity—blasphemy—and
the most disgusting impurities
which have ever swelled the black catalogue of
human crimes.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>The arrest of Cosmo de’ Medici filled the heart of
Filelfo with the greatest joy, as it not only freed him
from the dread of a formidable adversary, but also gratified
his pride, by fulfilling certain prophetic denunciations
with which he had concluded his satire against confidence
in wealth. In the exhilaration of triumph, he exulted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
over the fallen demagogue, to whom he gave the fictitious
name of Mundus, in a copy of verses, in the conclusion
of which he earnestly exhorted the Florentine nobility not
to endanger the safety of the state, by commuting the
punishment of death, which their prisoner merited, for the
lighter penalty of banishment.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> Happily for Cosmo, as it
has been already related, the sanguinary counsels of his
personal enemies were rejected.</p>

<p>Thus when Poggio arrived in Florence, he found the
party of his kindest friends reduced to a state of irksome
humiliation—his most powerful protector driven into exile;
and his most intimate associates daily annoyed by the
rancorous effusions of a libeller, whose malignant imagination
seemed to supply an inexhaustible store of topics of
abuse. In these circumstances, by the fidelity of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
attachment to the persecuted partizans of the Medici, he
drew down upon his own head the lightning of Filelfo’s
wrath; and he soon found himself exhibited as a conspicuous
figure in the groups of outrageous caricaturas drawn
by the bold hand of the enraged satirist.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> During the
exile of Cosmo, his dread of incurring the displeasure of
the ruling faction induced him to submit to obloquy in
silence; and Filelfo enjoyed the mean triumph of those
who wantonly malign an adversary whose pen is restrained
by the strong hand of the civil power. But this triumph<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
was of short duration. The first year of Cosmo’s banishment
was not expired, before he was recalled by the commanding
voice of the people. On his approach to the
city his enemies fled; and amongst the rest, Filelfo, conscious
of the provocations by which he had stimulated his
resentment, hastily quitted Florence, and withdrew to
Siena.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p>Poggio expressed his joy on the return of his friend
in a long epistle, in the commencement of which he intimated,
that he had chosen that mode of address in preference
to a personal congratulation, in order that his commendation
of his patron might be diffused amongst such
of the learned as felt an interest in the perusal of his
compositions. He then proceeded to dilate at considerable
length upon the unanimity with which the Florentine
people passed the decree of the recall of Cosmo, which,
he justly observed, was a most distinguished proof of his
merits. “This is,” said he, “in my opinion, the greatest
subject of congratulation in your case—that all ranks
concurred in bearing testimony to your dignity and virtue.
So earnest was the desire of your return, that the inconveniences
resulting to yourself from your exile, must be
far overbalanced by the unprecedented honour and affection
with which your fellow citizens have received you on
your return to your native country.” He concluded this
epistle by exhorting his friend to persevere in those virtuous
principles which had been his support in the day of adversity,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
and which had caused him to be restored to the exalted
rank in the state from which he had been for a short period
displaced by the intrigues of faction.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>Poggio had long meditated a signal retaliation of the
insults which he had experienced from Filelfo; and no
sooner did the Medici regain their ascendancy in the republic,
than he proceeded to administer to the acrimonious
Tolentine the merciless severity of a literary castigation.
Wisely stepping forward as the indignant friend of the
injured Niccolo Niccoli, rather than as the avenger of his
own wrongs, he published an invective against Filelfo, in
which he almost exhausted the Latin language in the accumulation
of epithets of abuse. Noticing the obscenity of
the satire which, as he says, Filelfo “had vomited forth
against his friend, from the feculent stores of his putrid
mouth,” he reproved him for the use of terms and
phrases which even a strumpet of any degree of reputation
would be ashamed to utter. The propensity of the satirist
to the adoption of such language, he ascribed to the early
taste which he had acquired for impurity, in consequence of
the occupation of his mother, whom he represented as
living at Rimini, engaged in the most sordid offices.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>
Tracing the history of his antagonist from his earliest days,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
he alleged, that he was banished from Padua, in consequence
of his indulgence of the most depraved propensities;
and that, when he had been hospitably entertained at
Constantinople by John Crysoloras, he repaid the kindness
of his host by debauching his daughter. By the perpetration
of this crime, if credit may be given to the assertions
of Poggio, Filelfo obtained the hand of a lady, to whom,
if her conduct had been in any degree answerable to the
nobility of her descent, he would never have had the
audacity to aspire.<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> Finally, the enraged secretary accused
his adversary of bartering the honour of his wife for the
most vicious gratifications, and concluded his invective by
proposing to ornament his brows—not with a wreath of
laurel, but with a crown more befitting the filthiness of
his conversation.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>This scurrility, as it might have been naturally expected,
served only to inflame the hostile passions which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
had so long rankled in the breast of Filelfo, and to direct
his fury against his new assailant. The exiled professor,
accordingly, once more dipping his pen in gall, traduced
the morals, and vilified the talents of Poggio, in a bitter
satire of one hundred verses in length; of the virulence
of which the reader may form some idea from the following
translation of its commencement.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The publication of this poem again roused the vindictive
spirit of Poggio, who retorted the acrimony of
his adversary in a second invective, in which he accused
him of the basest ingratitude to those who had treated him
with the most distinguished kindness. Amongst these he
particularly enumerated Niccolo Niccoli, Ambrogio Traversari,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
Carlo and Leonardo Aretino, Francesco Barbaro,
Guarino Veronese, and several others, all of whom, he
asserted, being disgusted by the petulance and scandalous
immorality of Filelfo, had found themselves compelled
to withdraw from him their countenance and support.
Warmed by his subject, Poggio concluded this philippic
with the following impassioned burst of scurrility. “Thou
stinking he-goat! thou horned monster! thou malevolent
detracter! thou father of lies and author of discord!
May the divine vengeance destroy thee as an enemy
of the virtuous, a parricide who endeavourest to ruin
the wise and good by lies and slanders, and the most
false and foul imputations. If thou must be contumelious,
write thy satires against the suitors of thy wife—discharge
the putridity of thy stomach upon those who
adorn thy forehead with horns.”</p>

<p>Such was the style in which Poggio and Filelfo, two
of the most learned men of their age, conducted their
disputes. In their mutual accusations, so evidently do
they aim at exhausting every topic of obloquy, without the
slightest regard to veracity, that it is impossible for the
acutest judgment, by the most careful examination of the
odious mass of their allegations, to distinguish truth from
falsehood. Thus does their acrimony defeat its own purpose:
for who will give credit to those, who, in the heat
of altercation, set decency at defiance; and forgetting
what is due to their own dignity, concentrate all their
powers in an endeavour to overwhelm their adversary by
virulent and foul abuse? It may, however, be observed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
that in this unmanly warfare Filelfo had the advantage,
in consequence of his superior sagacity in the choice of his
weapons. In these encounters, a prose invective is like a
ponderous mace, the unmanageable weight of which is the
best security of him at whom the blow is aimed. But he
who annoys his antagonist by poetic effusions, assails him
with an instrument, which affords full scope for the exercise
of the most consummate dexterity. The effect of
abusive attacks against character or talents upon him who is
the subject of obloquy, is generally proportionate to the
reception which those attacks experience from the public.
And it is obvious to remark, that a dilated oration is
almost uniformly wearisome to the reader, and few of its
passages are remembered after its perusal; but the happy
turn of an epigram, or the pointed numbers of a lengthened
satire, captivate the fancy, strongly arrest the public
attention, and make a durable impression on the memory.
Thus do the lashes of poetic wit produce a poignant and
a lasting smart; and truly unfortunate is he who, in consequence
of the provocation of literary wrath, becomes</p>

<p>Soon after the commencement of the late insurrection,
which, as it has been already related, compelled Eugenius
to provide for his safety by a precipitate flight, the Roman
populace proceeded to the election of seven officers, to
whom they delegated the most ample authority to enforce
the preservation of the public peace, and to promote the
general welfare. On the departure of the pontiff, these
new magistrates found themselves masters of the whole of
the city except the castle of St. Angelo. They immediately
commenced the siege of this fortress; but their efforts
to reduce it were vain. In the mean time the troops of
Sforza made frequent incursions to the very gates of the
city, spreading terror and devastation through the surrounding
territory. The garrison of the castle also harrassed the
citizens by daily sallies. Wearied and disheartened by the
inconveniences resulting from this concurrence of external
and internal warfare, the degenerate Romans, at the end of
the fifth month of the enjoyment of their delusive liberty,
surrendered their principal places of strength to Giovanni
de’ Vitelleschi, bishop of Recanati, who took possession
of them in the name of the pontiff.<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span></p>

<p>Though the standard of revolt no longer waved
defiance against established government from the walls of
Rome, and though the populace seemed to be desirous of
atoning by the humblest submission for the outrages which
they had lately committed, not only against the authority,
but also against the person of their sovereign, Eugenius
did not yet venture to revisit his capital. He wisely
dreaded the effects of that agitation which usually accompanies
the subsiding of the stormy sea of political contention.
It was also the opinion of his counsellors, that it was
necessary to punish the ringleaders of the late revolt with
the utmost severity; and he perhaps thought that those
princes act consistently with the dictates of prudence, who,
whilst they personally interpose in the performance of
beneficent and merciful actions, delegate to inferior agents
the odious task of inflicting the sanguinary penalties of
political vengeance. He accordingly instructed Vitelleschi
to take such measures as he should deem necessary for the
extinction of the latent sparks of rebellion. For the purposes
of severity he could not have selected a fitter instrument
than Vitelleschi, a man of haughty demeanour, a
bigotted assertor of the rights of established power, whose
promptitude in action was guided by the dictates of a cool
head, and an obdurate heart. When the inhabitants of
the pontifical states were informed that their destiny was
committed to the disposal of this merciless ecclesiastic,
they were struck dumb with fear;<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> and suspicion and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
terror spread a gloom over the whole of the papal dominions.
No long space of time intervened before the
threatening cloud burst upon the heads of the Colonnas
and their partizans. Vitelleschi, personally assuming the
command of a body of troops, laid siege to the fortresses
which sheltered the despairing remnant of rebellion. In
the course of a few weeks he took and sacked Castel Gandolfo,
Sabello, Borghetto, Alba, Città Lanuvie, and Zagarola.
All the inhabitants of these places who survived
the carnage which occurred at their capture he carried in
chains to Rome. On his return to the capital he proceeded
to level with the ground the houses of the principal insurgents.
Determined by still severer measures to strike
terror into the enemies of the pontiff, he seized one of the
ringleaders of the late revolt, and after publicly exposing
him to the horrible torture of having his flesh torn with red
hot pincers, he terminated his sufferings, by causing him to
be hanged in the Campo di Fiore. At the same time,
with a view of ingratiating himself with the populace, who
dreaded the horrors of approaching famine, he imported
into the city an abundant supply of provisions. By this
alternate exercise of severity and conciliation, he at length
completely re-established the authority of the pontiff in
Rome.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>Fortune now began to dispense her favours to Eugenius
with a liberal hand. In the spring of the year 1435,
Fortebraccio, having received intelligence that Francesco<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
Sforza had marched into Romagna to oppose Piccinino,
who was preparing to invade that district at the head of
a large body of troops, made a forced march, and surprising
Leone Sforza, who had been left at Todi with an army of
one thousand horse and five hundred foot, compelled him
and the greater part of his forces to surrender at discretion.
His triumph was, however, but of short duration. Whilst
he was employed in the siege of Capo del Monte, he was
attacked by Alessandro Sforza, and after an obstinate engagement,
in which he received a mortal wound, his troops were
entirely defeated. This event, which rid Eugenius of a
formidable and implacable foe, prepared the way for a treaty
of peace between him and his various enemies. The pontiff
derived considerable advantages from the terms of this treaty,
in consequence of which he regained possession of Imola and
Bologna, and saw Romagna freed from the miseries of war.<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>On the second of February in this year Joanna, queen
of Naples, died, by her last will leaving the inheritance of
her kingdom to Regnier of Anjou. The claim of Regnier
was, however, disputed by Alfonso of Arragon, who,
by virtue of the act of adoption which Joanna had annulled,
asserted his title to the Neapolitan crown. Whilst the
kingdom of Naples was divided and harrassed by these
contending claimants, Eugenius ordered Vitelleschi to take
possession of certain towns situated on its frontiers, the
sovereignty of which had long been asserted, and occasionally
enjoyed, by the Roman pontiffs. Vitelleschi executed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
this commission with his usual good fortune; and by the
conquests which he made in the Neapolitan territories,
still farther extended the power of his master.<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p>Whilst the flames of war which had been kindled
against Eugenius by the machinations of the duke of Milan
were thus gradually extinguished, the members of the
council of Basil proceeded with considerable diligence in
the execution of the difficult task which they had undertaken—the
reformation of the church in its head and
members. After settling some preliminary arrangements,
with a view of facilitating the union of the Greek and
Latin churches, and promoting the conversion of the Jews,<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
the assembled fathers proceeded to denounce against those
priests who disgraced their profession by keeping concubines,
the penalty of the forfeiture of their ecclesiastical revenues
for the space of three months; and the further penalty of
deprivation in case they continued, after solemn admonition,
to persevere in their flagitious conduct.<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> In a very long
and particular decree they laid down wholesome regulations
for the decent solemnization of public worship; and strictly
prohibited the continuance of those sacrilegious buffooneries
which it had been customary in some countries to
celebrate in the churches on Innocents’ day, or the feast of
fools.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> Eugenius perhaps felt no repugnance to give his
assent to these articles of reformation. But he could not
consider with complacency a decree of the ninth of June,
whereby the payment of annates, and of the first fruits of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
benefices, into the pontifical treasury, was prohibited as an
unlawful compliance with a simoniacal demand.<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> This
ordinance he naturally detested, as tending materially to
impair his revenues, and consequently to diminish his
power. The spirit of hostility against the undue influence
of the head of the church, which actuated the deliberations
of the council, was further manifested by a decree of the
twenty-fifth of March, 1436, whereby the pontiff was
prohibited from bestowing the government of any province,
city, or territory appertaining to the church, on any of his
relatives, to the third generation inclusive.<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> These proceedings
evidently proved, that whatever benefits the synod
of Basil might extend to the general community of Christians,
the successor of St. Peter was likely to sustain considerable
loss in consequence of its labours; and Eugenius
determined to seize the earliest opportunity of throwing off
its yoke.<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span></p>

<p>Whilst the power and activity of the pontiff’s enemies
seemed to throw a considerable degree of uncertainty upon
the future destiny of the father of the faithful, Poggio
appears to have made preparations permanently to fix his
own residence in the Tuscan territory. With this view
he purchased a villa in the pleasant district of Valdarno.
It appears from a letter addressed by Beccatelli, of Palermo,
to Alphonso, king of Naples, that Poggio raised a part of
the fund necessary for the making of the purchase by the
sale of a manuscript of Livy, written with his own hand,
and for which he obtained the sum of one hundred and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
twenty florins of gold.<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> In the choice of the situation of his
intended mansion, he was guided by that love of rural
retirement which is generally experienced by men of contemplative
minds, who are compelled by the nature of their
occupation to engage in the active scenes of society. To
him who has been distracted by the bustle and tumult of a
court, whose spirits have been jaded by the empty parade of
pomp, and whose ingenuous feelings have been wounded by
the intrigues of ambition, the tranquil pleasures and
innocent occupations of a country life appear to possess a
double charm.</p>

<p>Whilst Poggio was thus providing for himself a place
of peaceful retirement, he received from the administrators
of the Tuscan government a testimony of respect, equally
honourable to the givers and to the receiver. By a public
act, which was passed in his favour, it was declared, that
whereas he had announced his determination to spend his
old age in his native land, and to dedicate the remainder of
his days to study; and whereas his literary pursuits would
not enable him to acquire the property which accrued to
those who were engaged in commerce, he and his children
should from thenceforth be exempted from the payment of
all public taxes.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p>The fortune of Poggio was, indeed, still very small,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
and consequently his villa could not vie in splendour with
the palaces of the Tuscan aristocracy; but he wisely
attempted to compensate by taste what he wanted in
magnificence. In pursuance of this design he rendered his
humble mansion an object of attention to the lovers of the
liberal arts, by the treasures of his library, and by a small
collection of statues, which he disposed in such a manner
as to constitute a principal ornament of his garden, and the
appropriate furniture of an apartment which he intended to
dedicate to literary conversation.<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<p>The study of ancient sculpture had long engaged the
attention of Poggio, who was not less diligent in rescuing
its relics from obscurity, than in searching for the lost
writers of antiquity. During his long residence in Rome,
he assiduously visited the monuments of imperial magnificence,
which fill the mind of the traveller with awe, as
he traverses the ample squares and superb streets of the
former mistress of the nations. The ruins of these stupendous
edifices he examined with such minute accuracy,
that he became familiarly acquainted with their construction,
their use, and their history.<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> Hence the learned men who
had occasion to repair to the pontifical court were solicitous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
to obtain his guidance in their visits to these wonderful
specimens of industry and taste.<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> Whenever the avarice
or the curiosity of his contemporaries prompted them to
search into the ruined magnificence of their ancestors,
Poggio attended the investigation, anxious to recover from
the superincumbent rubbish some of those breathing forms,
the offspring of Grecian art, which the refined rapacity of
Roman generals had selected from amongst the spoils of
Greece, as ornaments worthy to adorn the temples and
palaces of the capital of the world. Nor did he confine
these researches to the precincts of Rome. The neighbouring
district witnessed his zeal for the restoration of the
monuments of ancient sculpture. With this interesting
object in view, he visited Grotta Ferrata, Tusculo, Ferentino,
Alba, Arpino, Alatri, Ostia, and Tivoli.<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> Whilst
he was fitting up his villa, he had the good fortune to pass
through Monte Cassino, at the time when an antique bust
of a female was discovered by some workmen, who were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
employed in digging up the foundation of a house. This
bust he purchased and added to his collection, which already
filled a chamber in his mansion.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> His inquiries after
specimens of art were also extended into distant countries.
Being informed that one Francesco di Pistoia was on the
eve of embarking for Greece, he requested him with the
utmost earnestness to procure for him any relics of Grecian
statuary which he might be able to obtain in the course of
his travels.<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> At the same time he wrote to a Rhodian, of
the name of Suffretus, a celebrated collector of antique
marbles, to inform him that he could not bestow upon him
a greater pleasure, than by transmitting to him one or more
of the pieces of sculpture which he might be able to spare
out of his well furnished gallery.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> Suffretus, actuated by
a noble spirit of liberality, immediately on Francesco’s
arrival in Rhodes, consigned to his care three marble busts,
one of Juno, another of Minerva, and the third of Bacchus,
said to be the works of Polycletus and Praxiteles,
and one statue of the height of two cubits, all which he
destined for Poggio.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> The annunciation of this intelligence
was received by Poggio with the highest exultation.
The names of such eminent artists as Polycletus and Praxiteles
raised, indeed, in his mind a prudent degree of
scepticism; but he dwelt with fond anticipation upon the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
pleasure which he should experience on the arrival of the
busts; and he instantly assigned to each of his expected
guests their proper stations in his villa. “Minerva,” says
he in a letter to Niccolo Niccoli, “will not, I trust, think
herself improperly situated beneath my roof—I will
place her in my library. I am sure Bacchus will find
himself at home in my house; for if any place is his
appropriated residence, that place is my native district,
where he is held in peculiar honour. As to Juno, she
shall retaliate the infidelities of her straying husband by
becoming my mistress.”<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<p>The busts in question arrived in safety at the place of
their destination;<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> but Francesco alleged that the statue
had been stolen out of the ship in which he returned from
Greece.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> Poggio strongly suspected that the plunderer who
had deprived him of this portion of his expected treasure
was no other than Francesco himself. In this suspicion he
was confirmed by his subsequent conduct. For this faithless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
agent having been afterwards commissioned by Andreolo
Giustiniano, a Genoese of considerable learning, to
convey to Poggio some antique busts, disposed of this
valuable deposit to Cosmo de’ Medici. Poggio did not
tamely bear this injury, but inveighed against the dishonesty
of the Pistoian with great bitterness in a letter which
he addressed to Giustiniano.<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> From this letter it appears,
that in addition to his groups of ancient statues, Poggio
had adorned his villa by a collection of antique coins and
gems. To these pursuits he was instigated, not merely
by the desire of illustrating the classic authors by a
reference to works of ancient art, but also by an enthusiastic
admiration of the sculptured wonders, the productions
of men endowed with superlative talents, who, rising from
individual to general nature, combined in their imaginations,
and embodied with their plastic hands, those finished forms
which, as it were, fill the mind of the spectator, and raise
him to the exalted idea of perfection.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> On this subject
he thus expressed himself in a letter to Francesco di Pistoia.
“I am struck with awe by the genius of the artist, when
I see the powers of nature herself represented in marble.
Different men are visited by different diseases. My
infirmity is an admiration of the works of excellent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
sculptors: for I cannot but be affected with astonishment
by the skill of the man who gives to inanimate substance
the expression of animation.”<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p>Whilst Poggio was thus occupied in adorning his
rural residence, he received a letter from one of his correspondents
named Scipio, of Ferrara, who requested him to
give him his opinion upon the question, whether Cæsar or
Scipio Africanus were the greater man. The discussion of
subjects of this description may give scope to a display of
historical knowledge; but it is seldom productive of much
utility. It is, perhaps, a proper exercise for youth; but
it is hardly worthy of the exertion of talents matured by
age. In compliance, however, with the wishes of his friend,
Poggio drew up an elaborate comparison between the two
eminent men in question, in the course of which he entered
much in detail into the history of their respective actions.
After this induction of particulars, he compressed his
arguments into a general statement of his opinion, that the
youth of Scipio was distinguished by the purest morals,
whilst the early years of Cæsar were rendered infamous by
his vices; that the former, inspired with the spirit of patriotism,
by his splendid military achievements rescued his
country from destruction; and that the latter, prompted by
ambition, too successfully exerted his extraordinary talents
to effect the subversion of the commonwealth—that consequently,
whilst Scipio was by no means inferior to Cæsar
in the fame of his military exploits, he was greatly his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
superior in virtue, which alone constitutes the character of
a truly great man.<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p>This dissertation on the comparative merits of Cæsar
and Scipio is ingenious and interesting; and in the pronunciation
of his decision, Poggio was certainly guided
by the principles of sound morality. It might reasonably
have been expected, that an inquiry into the character of
two illustrious ancients would be productive of nothing but
amusement and instruction; and little did Poggio imagine
that any of his contemporaries would be inflamed with
resentment by the freedom of his strictures upon the
accomplished vanquisher of Roman liberty. But his
treatise falling into the hands of Guarino Veronese, who
at this time filled the professor’s chair in the university of
Ferrara, that renowned preceptor, either actuated by intolerant
zeal in defence of the reputation of Cæsar, or
influenced by a desire of paying his court to Leonello
d’Este, who had frequently declared himself an admirer
of the dictator’s character, composed a long answer to the
inquiry of Poggio. The spirit and style of this composition
were by no means compatible with the friendly
sentiments which Guarino professed to entertain with regard
to his antagonist. In a kind of preface which he prefixed
to it, he contemptuously bestowed upon Poggio the
appellation of Cæsaromastix, and asserted, that in his
attack upon the character of Cæsar, he was rather audacious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
than brave.<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> Poggio was much displeased by this
provocation, and lost no time in replying to the unexpected
strictures of the Ferrarese professor. In this instance,
however, he had the discretion to restrain his anger within
due bounds. Avoiding as much as possible any altercation
with Guarino, he addressed himself to Francesco Barbaro,
in a long epistle, in which he dilated his original arguments,
and confirmed them by ample authorities. In the introduction
to this letter, he complained in a manly strain of
dignity of the conduct of Guarino, who had wantonly
wounded his feelings, by intermixing personal reflections in
the discussion of a literary question, on which all scholars
were equally entitled to unlimited freedom of opinion. In
this defence of his sentiments, Poggio exhibited much
learning and acuteness, and evinced the skill of a practised
disputant. As Guarino did not prosecute the discussion of
this subject, it may be presumed that he felt due compunction
for the breach of friendship into which he had been
inadvertently betrayed, and that, overpowered by the
superior abilities of his opponent, he shrunk from a renewal
of the combat. Guarino was not the only person whose
displeasure was excited by the preference given by Poggio
to Scipio over Cæsar. Another scholar of that age addressed
a letter to Leonardo Aretino, in the course of
which, in vindicating the fair fame of the Dictator, he
characterizes his censor as a rash and foolish writer. To
this second antagonist, however, who from his initials C. A.
is supposed to have been Cyriac of Ancona, Poggio did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
not condescend to make a formal reply, but contented himself
with ridiculing him in a letter addressed to their common
friend Leonardo.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p>Soon after the termination of this controversy, Poggio
happily lost the remembrance of the uneasiness occasioned
by the mutual recrimination of polemic disquisitions,
in the tender assiduities of honourable courtship.
As he was now arrived at the advanced age of fifty-five, the
intemperate heat of his passions was allayed, and the remonstrances
of his friend, the cardinal of St. Angelo, on
the subject of his unlicensed amours, began to make an
impression on his mind. He was also weary of the unsettled
state in which he had hitherto lived, and sighed
for the participation of those pure domestic comforts,
which heighten the pleasures, and alleviate the sorrows of
human life. He accordingly sought amongst the Tuscan
ladies for a partner of his future fortunes. The object of
his research he found in Vaggia, the daughter of Ghino
Manente de’ Bondelmonti, a lady of a wealthy and honourable
family, to whom he was united in the latter end of the
month of December, 1435.<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> From a memorandum inserted
in a diary kept by Manente, it appears, that he gave Poggio
together with his daughter the sum of six hundred florins<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>
as a marriage portion. Pecuniary affairs do not, however,
appear to have occupied much of the attention of the bridegroom,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
whose gallantry led him to dwell with happy pride
upon the most valuable of all dowries—the beauty and virtues
of his spouse. Previously to his taking the decisive step of
matrimony, Poggio deliberately weighed the probable advantages
and disadvantages which might arise from the disparity
of the ages of himself and Vaggia, who had not yet seen
eighteen summers. The result of his cogitations on this
interesting topic he set forth in a Latin dialogue on the
question—“<i>An seni sit uxor ducenda</i>,” which he published
soon after his marriage. This dialogue, to which was
originally prefixed a dedicatory epistle from its author to
Cosmo de’ Medici, is represented as having taken place
at a dinner given by Poggio, on occasion of his entering
into the holy state, to his friends Niccolo Niccoli and Carlo
Aretino. The former of these guests, in the freedom of
conversation over his wine, declares, with his habitual bluntness,
that nothing but insanity could have induced the
founder of the feast, by encumbering himself with matrimonial
duties, to undertake a burden which wisdom would
avoid at any period of life, but which must be particularly
grievous to one, like Poggio, far advanced in years. In
reply to this sally of caustic humour Poggio protests that
his experience of matrimony by no means vindicates
Niccolo’s opinion of that state, from which he has hitherto
derived nothing but satisfaction. Niccolo avers that he
hears with pleasure this declaration, to which he politely
professes to give full credence; but he at the same time
maintains, that, regarding the case of his friend as an
exception to a general rule, he cannot, abstractedly speaking,
applaud the wisdom of a man, who, at the age of fifty-five,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
enters upon a course of life quite alien from his former
habits. He then proceeds, in the style of an advocate
arguing on one side of a question, to enumerate all possible
suppositions as to defects in the character of the object of
an old man’s choice as a partner for the remainder of his
life. She may be peevish and morose—She may be intemperate,
immodest, idle and sluttish—If she is a maiden
and young, it will be found on trial that the levity of youth
will not harmonize with the gravity of advanced years—If
she be a widow, there is great hazard lest she should entertain
vivid recollections of the pleasures which she enjoyed
in her connexion with her former spouse—recollections
which will by no means operate to the advantage of her
present husband. As to the entering into an union with an
aged woman, this would be of course the feeble propping
and sustaining the feeble—it would be a proceeding productive
of nothing but a doubling of infirmity and discomfort.
For a literary man to enter into a connexion
which must trespass upon that time which should be devoted
to the cultivation of his mind were folly indeed—to all
which considerations must be added this most important
one, that if a man who marries late in life becomes the
father of children, he cannot expect to live to see the completion
of that education which he hopes may imbue his
offspring with that useful knowledge and with those virtuous
dispositions which are requisite to secure their success in the
world. At his death, then, he will be oppressed by the
painful reflection, that he must leave the objects of his fond
solicitude to the discretion of guardians, who have been
found in so many instances to be careless or unfaithful in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
the discharge of their important trust. “I am aware,” says
Niccolo at the termination of his speech, “that in some
cases circumstances may be different from what I have represented
them as likely to be. You, Poggio, for instance, are
fortunate if what you tell us of your matrimonial experience
is true—but yet I always have been, and still am, of opinion,
that safe counsels are to be preferred to hazardous ones.”</p>

<p>When Poggio, smiling at these remarks of Niccolo, is
preparing to reply to them, he is interrupted by his friend
Carlo, who begs from him permission to undertake the
management of the cause of the aged gentlemen who
become the votaries of Hymen; and, this being granted to
him, he begins his speech by making a personal attack upon
Niccolo, who, he alleges, has declined to enter into the
married state by an unreasonable timidity of spirit, and an
unaccommodating austerity of temper. But if all men were
to follow his example, they would manifestly act in disobedience
to the first law of nature, which provides for the
continued propagation of the human species, and they would
moreover grossly neglect the duty which they owe to the
state to which they belong, which demands from them that
succession of virtuous citizens by whom alone its rights and
liberties can be maintained. As to the cares and avocations
of matrimony breaking in upon literary occupations, Carlo
reminds his adversary that this was not the case with Plato,
with Aristotle, with Theophratus, Cato the elder, Cicero,
and many others of the ancients distinguished by the extent
of their learning. Matrimony also, which Niccolo has
vilified as a species of servitude, preserves a man from that
licentiousness of conduct which is the worst kind of slavery<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
in which he can be enthralled. Moreover, if any elderly
man be united to a young woman, his wisdom will be a
guide to her inexperience—his prudence will teach her to
restrain her appetites, and his example will in every case
afford her instruction and encouragement in the regulation
of her conduct in life.</p>

<p>On Niccolo’s appealing with a smile to the experience
of Carlo himself, and asking him whether he has not known
old men who have been more foolish than boys, and whether
people of this description are not very unsafe guides in the
discharge of moral and political duties, the latter replies
that he pleads not on the behalf of foolish people of any
age; but that he is ready to assert as a general principle,
that the matrimonial union is singularly well adapted to promote
the happiness of an elderly man. Young folks, he
says, are unable to regulate themselves; much less are they
qualified to govern others. What, then, will be the consequence
of an union of two parties, each of which is totally
inexperienced in the management of human affairs, but the
pressure of poverty, and its attendant train of miseries?
But the man who is ripe in years will support the weakness
of his wife, and instruct her ignorance in the ordering of
their domestic concerns, and will abate in her the effervescence
of passion by the inculcation of the lessons of
virtue.</p>

<p>Enlarging on these ideas, and more particularly analyzing
Niccolo’s objections to the marriage of men advanced
in years, Carlo boldly maintains, that it is expedient
for a person of this description not only to marry, but also to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
marry a young woman, whom he may mold like wax to his
will. As to sensual indulgences—whilst so many examples are
seen of the total abstinence from them which is practised in
convents and nunneries, why should any doubt be entertained,
that a well-instructed female will cheerfully submit
to that restricted enjoyment of them which circumstances
may demand from her? As to the little likelihood of an
aged parent living to see his offspring settled in the world,
Carlo demurs to the fact, and asserts that longevity is fully
as likely to follow upon the temperance of mature age as
upon the careless dissoluteness of youth. “But granting,”
says he, “that the remaining years of an old man are few in
number, will he not, nevertheless, derive the greatest
pleasure from his children, whom it will be a gratification to
him to train to good manners, at a period when they are
much more disposed to revere their parent, and to obey
him, than they are likely to be when growing strength and
self-confidence shall have rendered them more independent
of parental controul?”</p>

<p>Fortifying his doctrine by the test of facts, Carlo
appeals, in proof of the soundness of the principles which
he is maintaining, not only to the domestic history of Cato
the Elder and of Cicero, but still more especially to that of
Galeazzo Malatesta, who, having married a young wife in
the seventy-fourth year of his age, left behind him at his
death four sons, who became the most illustrious men of all
Italy, and one of whom, Carlo, was no less celebrated for
his literary accomplishments than for his prowess in war.—“These
illustrious characters,” says he, “were, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
virtuous by nature; but they were not a little indebted
for the renown which they obtained in their maturer years,
to the instructions which they received in their early
youth from their father. The wise exhortations of an
aged parent have, in my opinion,” continues he, “great
efficacy in the right training of children—a greater
efficacy, indeed, than if they fell from the lips of persons
of unripe years—for it is to advanced age that we look
for gravity and experience.” After enlarging on this
topic, Carlo draws from his reasonings the conclusion, that
both on public and on private grounds, it is expedient that
elderly men should quit the state of celibacy, and that they
should marry youthful wives. “It is,” he observes, “an
unspeakable advantage in life, for a man to have a partner
to whom, as to a second self, he may communicate his
counsels and his joys, and who, by sympathizing in, may
mitigate his sorrows. Nor is it to be doubted,” says he,
“that a wife of this description will continue to love her
husband as long as he loves her, and as long as he
maintains towards her that fidelity which is too often
violated by the impetuosity of youthful appetite.” He
then proceeds to controvert in their order the other positions
of Niccolo, who, however, is by no means converted from
his original opinions on the subject matter of the debate;
but closes the conference, by charging Carlo with uttering
the sentiments which he has propounded merely for the sake
of flattering their host, in return for the good dinner which
he has given to his friends; and by characteristically professing
that he will look to himself, and take care not to
suffer by imitating the follies of others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span></p>

<p>This dialogue on the question <i>An seni sit uxor
ducenda</i> is one of the most ingenious of Poggio’s compositions.
It evinces its author’s intimate acquaintance with
life and manners; and at the same time, in the lucidness
of its arrangement and the dexterity of its argumentation,
it exhibits a specimen of no common rhetorical powers.
In the course of the conversation between the interlocutors
Poggio indulges in the liveliness of fancy; but he never
transgresses the bounds of decorum. On the contrary,
though he introduces into the discussion some slippery
topics, he touches upon them with great delicacy; and it
may be stated, greatly to his honour, that, in the character
of the advocate of matrimony, he treats the female sex with
marked respect, and represents woman not only as gifted
with great acuteness of intellect, but also as endowed with
dispositions which incline her, as a rational being, to listen
with deference to the lessons of wisdom and virtue. To
which may be added, that the diction of this dialogue is
singularly correct, and that it evinces, on the part of its
author, a familiar acquaintance with the phraseology of
Cicero.<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span></p>

<p>Poggio’s resolution to correct the irregularity of his
conduct, and to enter into the state of lawful wedlock,
most certainly merited high commendation. It is to be
hoped, however, that he experienced the keenest remorse
of self-accusation for his former licentiousness, when he
found that the commencement of his reformation was to be
signalized by an act of extreme unkindness. In order to
prepare the way for his marriage, he was obliged to dismiss
a mistress who had borne him twelve sons and two daughters.
What distressing embarrassments crowd the train of vice;
and how powerfully are the benevolent feelings excited on
the side of virtue, when we see the object of licentious
passion, after a connexion of many years, in circumstances
which seem to imply on her part fidelity to her seducer,
at length abandoned by him, and sent forth, perhaps in
poverty—certainly in agonizing mental distress—to encounter
the taunts of public scorn.<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>

<p>If, however, we may give credit to Poggio’s account of
the state of his feelings on his entrance upon his new connexion,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
his felicity was not interrupted by any painful
reflections on the past, or by any uneasy forebodings with
respect to the future. In a letter to one of his English
friends, Nicholas Bilston, Archdeacon of Winchester, he
thus expresses himself on the subject of his marriage.</p>

<p>“Our epistolary intercourse, my dear father, has by
my omission been too long suspended. Do not, however,
impute my silence to forgetfulness of the obligations which
your goodness has conferred upon me; for I can assure you
that a sense of your kindness is impressed upon my mind
in indelible characters. The fact is, that till lately, no
event has occurred in my history of sufficient importance
to constitute the subject of a letter. But I have now to
announce to you a most important change in my situation—a
change, of which I hasten to give you the
earliest intelligence, in full confidence that you will
participate in my joys. You know that I have been
hitherto uncertain what course of life to pursue, and that
I have long hesitated whether to adopt the secular or the
clerical character. To the ecclesiastical profession, however,
I must confess that I never felt any inclination.
In this dubious state of mind, I arrived at a period when
it was absolutely requisite for me to fix upon some settled
plan for the regulation of my future conduct. Determining,
therefore, not to spend the remainder of my days
in unsocial solitude, I resolved to marry; and though
now declining into the vale of years, I have ventured to
enter into the matrimonial union with a young lady of
great beauty, and possessed of all the accomplishments<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
which are proper for her sex. You will perhaps say,
that I ought to have taken this step at an earlier period.
I confess it: but, as the old proverb says, ‘better late
than never;’ and you must remember that philosophers
assure us, that ‘<i>Sera nunquam est ad bonos mores
via</i>.’ I might, indeed, have changed my condition
many years ago; but in that case I should not have
obtained my present spouse, a partner in all respects
suited to my manners and disposition, in whose agreeable
converse I find a solace for all my anxieties and cares.
So richly is she endowed with virtues, that she gratifies
my most sanguine wishes. This circumstance is the
source of the greatest comfort to me; and I return
thanks to God, who, having continually been propitious
to me, ‘has loved me even to the end,’ and has bestowed
upon me more than I could have wished. Well knowing
your regard for me, and duly sensible of the value of
your friendship, I have thought it my duty to acquaint
you with my present circumstances, and to make you a
partaker in my pleasure. Farewell.”</p>

<p>This letter, which bears the date of the sixth of
February, 1436, was written in the course of that halcyon
period, during the continuance of which the fetters of
matrimony are usually entwined with flowers, and unmixed
pleasure is supposed to be the almost certain portion of the
newly united pair. In the strictness of investigation, therefore,
it cannot be admitted as evidence of the happiness
which Poggio enjoyed in the married state. Hymeneal
transports, however ardent, are proverbially fleeting; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
many a matrimonial union which has commenced in affection,
has been found productive of disgust. From various
detached passages, however, which occur in his future correspondence
with his friends, it appears that Poggio was not
disappointed in his hopes of conjugal felicity, and that his
connexion with Vaggia was a source of comfort to his
declining years.</p>

<p>On the eighteenth of April, [A. D. 1436.] Eugenius
quitted Florence, and transferred the pontifical court to
Bologna, whither he was accompanied by Poggio, who
soon after his arrival there, detailed his further experience
of the joys of wedded love in the following letter to the
cardinal of St. Angelo.</p>

<p>“You have frequently, most reverend father, exhorted
me, both in conversation and by letter, to adopt some settled
course of life. I have at length followed your advice.
Two plans were proposed to my consideration: to enter
into the priesthood, or to pursue some secular concern—To
the ecclesiastical profession I always entertained an
invincible objection—I disliked solitude; and therefore,
being determined to enter upon civil life, I turned my mind
to matrimony. I do not deny that the clerical life is
by many esteemed more peaceable and tranquil than that
which I have chosen. It is, indeed, generally regarded
as free from care, and as allowing the greatest scope to
ease and self-indulgence.—The opulence which it promises
to confer is also a powerful motive to impel men to the
adoption of it—a much more powerful one, indeed, than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
any considerations of a religious or moral nature. For
what numbers are there whose inquiry is directed after
wealthy benefices rather than after the rule of an upright
life. It is deemed honourable amongst mortals to excel
others in pomp, to be flattered and courted by the multitude,
to abound in riches, which procure that outward
splendour which is generally thought to constitute dignity.
And it is deemed still more honourable to obtain these advantages
without labour, and in a short time. Hence the
clergy, springing like mushrooms in an hour, are rapidly
advanced to the highest dignities. Thus it very frequently
happens, that you are obliged to venerate as a God, a
man whom you have been accustomed to despise as a
mean, abject, ignoble, and ill-bred character. By one
word of the pontiff, the ignorant become, in the estimation
of the vulgar, learned; the stupid wise; the uninstructed
accomplished—though at the same time the
real character of the men is precisely the same as it was
before.</p>

<p>“In addition to these considerations, I was well aware
how important is the dignified office of an ecclesiastic;
and what a weight of responsibility rests upon those who,
by accepting benefices, undertake the spiritual guidance
of their fellow men; and I was deterred from entering
upon the clerical functions by the strictness of the precepts
which are inculcated by the ancient doctors of the church.
For when I was informed by these most holy men, whose
works I had perused, to what uses the wealth of the
church ought to be appropriated—that he who does not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
work, ought not to eat—and that the labourer in spiritual
things ought to be content with food and raiment; and
when I was conscious that I was unfit for the discharge of
clerical duties; and when I knew that I could obtain
food and raiment by other, though certainly more
laborious means; I thought it advisable—not indeed to
contemn the former pursuit, but to adopt the latter,
which seemed more suitable to my disposition. That
warfare is, I must confess, better and more illustrious
in which men can attain to a greater pitch of merit,
provided they conduct themselves according to the rules
of religion and their office. But after maturely examining
my own strength and ability, I was afraid of
engaging in a field, in which I should incur the almost
certain danger of basely yielding to the adversary, or of
falling in the combat, to the hazard of my soul.</p>

<p>“Being determined therefore to employ myself in
secular concerns, in forming my matrimonial engagement,
I adopted those principles which have obtained the approbation
of the wise and learned. For in the choice of a
wife, I was not influenced by riches, which render the
generality of men blind to their true interests—nor was
I prompted by a wish to rise to civil honours, or to
strengthen my interest with the great. These are objects
of earnest desire to the multitude at large. But I was
influenced by different motives. In looking out for a
partner for life, I looked for honour, probity, virtue,
which the wisest of men have declared to be the most
ample dower which a parent can bestow upon his child.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
Being, then, well acquainted with the excellent dispositions,
the modesty, and the other characteristic virtues of
a certain young lady of noble family, who had not yet
completed her eighteenth year, on her I fixed my choice.
The exemplariness of this lady’s manners was acknowledged
by every body who was acquainted with her; and
the excellence of her character I esteemed her most
striking recommendation. Such indeed is her beauty,
that I cannot but occasionally reflect with seriousness on
the disparity of our years—however, as I knew that from
her tender youth, she had been educated in such a manner,
that she had a still greater share of good principles
and of modesty, than of comeliness and grace of person,
I determined to make her my own. Nor have I repented
of my resolution. For so much does she daily rise in my
esteem, that I continually give thanks to God, who, in
former times has always blessed me with more than, on
account of my sins, I could possibly deserve; and in
bestowing upon me so excellent a wife, has so bountifully
provided for my comfort and satisfaction, that there is
nothing that I can wish for in addition to his present
mercies.</p>

<p>“Our friend Zucharo was accustomed to say, when he
wished to commend some exquisitely dressed dish, that
it was so delicately seasoned that the least alteration in its
composition would spoil it. So say I of my wife. There
is nothing which I wish to be added to her character, nor
any thing which I wish to be taken away from it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span></p>

<p>“I must now tell you the reason why I have been
so late in writing to you on this subject. It is a common
observation, that there are few if any married
men who do not become weary of their wives in the
course of a year. The pontiff has allowed me six
months for my period of probation. The fifth month
is now expired; and my wife daily grows upon my
esteem, and is daily more agreeable to me, and more
compliant with my wishes. Forming a conjecture as to
the future from my experience of the past, I am inspired
by a confident expectation that I shall never repent of
having formed this connexion. I trust also that God will
continue to me his favour. For if he was propitious to
me when I strayed from the path of moral rectitude, I
may reasonably hope, that since I have entered upon the
right way he will shower down his blessings upon me with
a still more liberal hand. But whatever may happen in the
course of the changes which take place in this sublunary
world, I shall never repent of having acted uprightly. I
wished to communicate this intelligence to you, my dear
friend, in order that you might rejoice in my joy. I am
sensible that the gravity of your wisdom might claim a
more weighty subject of correspondence: but the wisest
of men occasionally indulge themselves with a little relaxation
from serious pursuits. This relaxation I trust you
will experience in the perusal of my present epistle.”<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<p>Guarino Veronese embraced the occasion of Poggio’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
marriage to renew the friendly intercourse with him which
had been unhappily suspended in consequence of their late
dispute. He addressed him on this joyful occasion in a
congratulatory letter, to which Poggio replied with the most
cordial frankness. “In your epistle,” said he, “which I
received by the kindness of Francesco of Ferrara, I
recognize my friend Guarino, who was formerly inferior
to no one in the testimonies of his affection towards me.
I am happy to find, that though your ability in maintaining
the intercourse of friendship may have been suspended,
it is not lost. I also am the same that I ever was—your
most faithful friend. Be assured that my regard for
you has not suffered the least diminution. A difference
of opinion can never justify a breach of friendship. Our
late contention, in which we engaged for the purpose of
exercising our abilities in the bestowing of praise and the
infliction of censure, was highly commendable. The
great men of antiquity adopted different sides of the
question in the senate and at the bar, without the least
infringement of the duties of friendship. It would indeed
redound to our disgrace, if the similarity of our
studies, which is usually the firmest bond of union,
should dissolve that pleasing connection which has subsisted
for so long a space of time. The learned and
justly renowned Francesco Barbaro, during his late visit to
Florence, intimated to me his suspicions, that my friendly
regard for you was somewhat diminished. I told him
that his suspicions were entirely groundless; that my
esteem for you was so far from being diminished, that it
was increased—I also promised to write to you. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
promise I should certainly have immediately fulfilled, had
I not been prevented by the press of business occasioned
by the departure of the pontiff.</p>

<p>“Accept my thanks for your kind congratulation on
the late change in my condition. I hope I shall find it
productive of perpetual comfort and pleasure. For since,
as Flaccus says, the virtue of parents is a great dowry,
I have had this alone in view, and have overlooked riches
and other recommendations, which the generality of men
regard as indispensably requisite to the happiness of the
married state. Petronius Arbiter asserts, that wisdom
and beauty are rarely allied—but by the favour of heaven,
I am united to a wife, who, though she has not yet completed
her eighteenth year, and is distinguished by her
beauty, is yet more virtuous than she is fair, and comprehends
in her character all the graces which adorn the
female sex. I trust, therefore, that I have made a provision
of comfort for my future years, though some of
my friends say that I am beginning a new art, at the time
when I ought to be quitting it. But it is never too late
to do what is right and honest: and as good poets take
especial pains in polishing the last act of their play, I am
resolved to dedicate the remainder of my days to purity of
conduct.”<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>At this time, the Florentines and the Venetians, being
at war with the Duke of Milan, had engaged as their ally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
Giovan Francesco Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua; and
whilst hostilities were carrying on between the above mentioned
parties, the eldest son of the Marquis, being an
ardent admirer of the character of Niccolo Piccinino, who
held a station of distinction in the Milanese army, had
secretly quitted his father’s house, and had entered into the
service of the Duke for the purpose of studying the art of
war under the auspices of that celebrated Condottiere. Gonzaga
was so much irritated by this conduct of his son, that
he disinherited him, as being, by a species of desertion,
guilty of a capital crime. The young prince, whilst this
judgment hung suspended over his head, having been
ordered by Piccinino to guard with a body of troops the
lines by which the town of Barga was beleaguered by the
Milanese forces, was wounded and taken prisoner in a
battle which he fought with Francesco Sforza, one of the
commanders in the pay of the Florentine republic. The
repentant run-away having, on his recovery, taken service
under Sforza, and thus rejoined the standard of his native
country, applied to his father for forgiveness of his fault.
But he solicited for pardon in vain. Gonzaga, either
indulging the natural severity of his disposition, or fearing
to excite the jealousy of the Venetians, should he pass
over so heinous a crime, turned a deaf ear to the suit of the
youthful warrior, and sternly refused to mitigate the doom
which he had pronounced upon him.</p>

<p>Deeply affected by this incident, Poggio, who was then
with the pontifical court at Bologna, wrote to the Marquis
a long and elaborate letter, in which he pleaded, with a zeal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
enlightened by the principles of humanity, for an extension
of mercy to the juvenile offender. In this eloquent composition,
after an appropriate introduction, in which he touched
upon the difficulty of the task of regulating human conduct
according to contingent circumstances, and the necessity of
due reflection for the proper discharge of moral duties,
Poggio reminded the Marquis, that, learned and prudent
as he was justly accounted, yet as a sovereign he was liable
to be led astray by his passions, which were likely to be
fostered rather than restrained by the applause of interested
flatterers, whose constant object it is to prevent the voice of
reason from approaching the ears of men invested with
power. This remark he aptly illustrated by a reference to
the history of Augustus Cæsar, who, having repented of
the severity with which he had treated his delinquent
daughter Julia, exclaimed in the bitterness of his feelings,
that he should not have conducted himself towards her
with so much harshness, had Marcus Agrippa and Mecænas
been still living, who alone of his courtiers dared freely
to tell him the truth.</p>

<p>Poggio then proceeds, in the character of an honest
adviser, to represent to the Marquis, that it is the opinion
of the most competent judges of the actions of princes,
that the punishment, which he professes to be determined
to inflict on his son, is more severe than just. The delinquency
of the prince involved no stain upon his honour.
On the contrary, it was occasioned by an excess of generous
feeling. Why, then, should he be subjected to a penalty
befitting a traitorous conspirator, or a fratricide? The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
Marquis may perhaps imagine that the example of Brutus
and that of Manlius Torquatus may be pleaded in defence
of his obduracy, but he begs him to remember that those
illustrious Romans did not avenge with the fatal axe their
own wrongs, but those of the republic. Becoming animated
as he proceeds in the discussion of his subject, Poggio,
quitting the apologetic style, pronounces an eulogium on
the young Gonzaga, who, instead of devoting himself like
a Sybarite to the pleasures and the pastimes of a court,
had, in pursuit of glory, encountered the perils and the
fatigues of war. Then, relating another anecdote of the
second of the Roman emperors, who, being consulted by
Titus Arrius, as to the punishment which he should inflict
on his son, who had been guilty of plotting against his life,
had given it as his opinion, that the offender should be
banished, rather than put to death, he maintains that the
same principle which prompted Augustus to award a
mitigated penalty against a young man convicted of so
atrocious a crime as meditated parricide, should induce the
Marquis to treat with lenity the juvenile indiscretion of his
son. Then appealing to the remorse and penitence of the
prince, he urges the offended father to receive the returning
prodigal with kindness; and, descending from the flights
of eloquence to the plain level of prudential consideration, he
concludes his letter by admonishing the Marquis, that if
he should persevere in his design of disinheriting his eldest
born son, that son had proved by his late conduct that he
was too high spirited to submit to the threatened indignity,
and that, however submissive he might be during his
father’s life, the death of the Marquis would be the signal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
of a civil war, which would lay waste the Mantuan territory,
and which would only terminate with the shameful victory
of one of his children over the other, or with the ruin of
both.</p>

<p>When Poggio had finished the composition of this
letter, he in the first instance consigned it to the care of
Vittorino da Feltre, a scholar of high reputation, who then
held the confidential office of preceptor to the sons of
Gonzaga, requesting him to watch for some favourable
moment for presenting it to his patron. This very precaution
should seem to intimate, that Poggio felt a latent
consciousness that the liberty which he was taking in
assuming the office of a monitor, might possibly not be
very acceptable to the distinguished personage to whom his
admonition was addressed. And yet, such was the pride
of scholarship in the fifteenth century, that when, at the
end of two months, his letter was returned to him by
Vittorino, with an intimation that Gonzaga declined
receiving it, Poggio addressed a second letter to the
unrelenting father, protesting that he had been influenced,
in requesting his attention to wholesome lessons of advice,
not by any selfish motives, but by his zeal for the welfare
of a sovereign prince, from whom he unequivocally declared
that he thought himself entitled, in consideration of his
good offices, to a return of gratitude rather than of contempt.
At the same time he wrote to Vittorino, expostulating
with him for the want of zeal, which he had evinced
with regard to the commission with which he had entrusted
him; and understanding that Carlo Brognolo, an intimate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
acquaintance of his, resident at the Mantuan court, had
endeavoured to induce the Marquis to excuse the liberty
which he had taken in writing to him, he wrote to him also,
thanking him for his friendly intentions; but at the same
time protesting, that he had only addressed the sovereign
of Mantua by letter in the manner in which, had an opportunity
presented itself, he would have addressed him personally,
namely, in a style and tone becoming the citizen of a free
state.</p>

<p>There is reason to believe that the displeasure felt by
the Mantuan prince against the officious scribe was not
deeply rooted or of long duration; for it appears that Gonzaga,
having come to Ferrara when the council was assembled
in that city in the year 1438, took occasion, in the
presence of a numerous audience, to speak of Poggio in
terms of respect and praise, for which honour the latter tendered
to his Highness, by letter, his grateful thanks.<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p>The literary reputation of Poggio now began to be
very extensively diffused, and his writings became an object
of frequent inquiry among the learned. Several eminent
scholars had been so much gratified by the perusal of some
of his letters, which had accidentally fallen into their hands,
that they earnestly requested him to publish a collection of
them. This request could not but be highly gratifying to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
his feelings, and he readily took the requisite steps to comply
with it. He accordingly desired Niccolo Niccoli, with
whom, as being his most intimate friend, he had maintained
a constant correspondence, to select from his papers such of
his letters as were likely to reflect lustre on his character;
and he was engaged in arranging and correcting the materials
for a small volume, at the time when the pontifical court
was transferred from Florence to Bologna. On resuming
his task in the latter city, he found that Niccolo had neglected
to transmit to him various letters which he had addressed
to him from France and Germany, and which he thought
would be peculiarly interesting to the public, as they contained
an account of his successful exertions in search of the
lost writers of antiquity. Niccolo was not so active as Poggio
could have wished in procuring for him these necessary
documents. The letters in question were in all probability
dispersed in the hands of various persons, and of course he
would experience some delay and difficulty in collecting
them. In fact they were never recovered by Poggio, who
completed from the materials which he had in his own possession
a volume<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> of his epistles, which he submitted to the
inspection of the public, dedicating it to the Canonico
Francesco Marescalco of Ferrara.<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> A copy of this volume
is preserved amongst the manuscripts of the Riccardi
library in Florence.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span></p>

<p>The transmission of his letters was one of his last acts
of friendship which Poggio requested from Niccolo Niccoli.
Soon after the publication of his epistles, he received the
melancholy intelligence of the death of this his earliest and
steadiest friend. He was acutely sensible of the serious loss
which he had sustained by this event, which took place on
the 23rd of January, 1437; and in the ardour of his affection,
he waited with patience for the publication of some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
tribute of respect to the memory of the deceased, which he
thought might justly be demanded from the multitude of
learned men, on whom the numerous favours which they had
received from the hands of Niccolo imposed an imperious
obligation to celebrate his virtues.<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> In this expectation he
was disappointed. The scholars of Florence were, perhaps,
of opinion, that panegyrics on the living were more productive
of profit than encomiums on the dead. Offended
by their tardiness, Poggio resolved, notwithstanding the
urgency and variety of his occupations, to rescue the name
of his friend from oblivion. He accordingly composed and
published a funeral eulogium on Niccolo Niccoli; being
determined, as he said in a letter to Feltrino Boiardo, to
merit, at least, the praise which is due to the faithful discharge
of the offices of friendship.<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>In his funeral oration on Niccolo, Poggio, adopting the
character of the orator appointed to address the public on
the occasion of his obsequies, introduced the eulogy of his
deceased friend by the following exordium.</p>

<p>“If, citizens of Florence! it had been consistent with
the dignity of the Latin muses personally to address you
on the present occasion, they would not have delegated
this office to another—they would themselves, in the
most copious and ornamented language, have celebrated
the virtues of their most excellent and praise-worthy child.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
But since those whose transcendent majesty prevents them
from exhibiting themselves to the eyes of the public, commission
their representatives to appear on their behalf—though
I know that there are many in this assembly,
whose learning, whose genius, and whose oratorical abilities
are far superior to mine, I have ventured to claim
your attention—not with a view of precluding the more
enlightened efforts of others; but in hopes that, whilst I
thus discharge the imperious duties of friendship, my
humble exertions may lead the way to more splendid
specimens of eloquence. And should my powers fall far
short of the merits of the deceased—should I be unable
to pay a tribute of respect in any degree adequate to the
services which I have received from him, you will, I trust,
pardon me, not merely in consideration of the mediocrity
of my talents, but also in consideration of the multitude
of the virtues of our departed friend. Abilities far superior
to any which I possess are requisite to execute the
task of enumerating, in the brief space of time which is
usually allotted to these occasions, the numerous excellent
qualities of the deceased.—But why do I say deceased?
Niccolo undoubtedly lives, and will for ever live. He
will be held in everlasting remembrance in the minds of
men, and he enjoys that immortality, which alone is
deserving of the name of life. We firmly believe, that
his pure soul, freed from every corporeal stain, no longer
obnoxious to the contagion of sin, has been at once exalted
into heaven. For he was a man of the most upright
conduct, endued with singular modesty, during every
period of his mortal existence. Connecting the study of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
polite learning with that of the sacred scriptures, he
ascended from knowledge to practice, and rendered his
literary pursuits subservient to the regulation of his moral
conduct. In order that you may become more particularly
acquainted with his character, permit me to enter a little
at large upon the subject of his studies and learning, his
moral qualities, and the uprightness of his conversation.
For the contemplation of the example of excellent men
is a powerful incitement to an imitation of their virtues.”</p>

<p>Pursuing the method thus pointed out, Poggio proceeded
to give an account of the education and early
pursuits of his friend, and made honourable mention of
the good services which he had rendered to the cause of
literature. He next entered into a particular detail of his
virtuous dispositions, celebrating, with appropriate praise,
his prudence, his benevolence, his fortitude, his contempt
of wealth, and the gravity of his manners. At length,
mentioning the serenity with which he met his dissolution,
he thus concluded. “Oh fatal day! bitter indeed to us;
but to him the happy termination of evils. At thy
destiny, Niccolo, (for I will once more address our
departed friend) at thy destiny I rejoice, for thou
inhabitest the abodes of the pious, and art entered into
the mansions of eternal rest. It is for myself I grieve—on
my own account I lament this fatal day, which has
deprived me of thy delightful converse, of thy tender
affection, which has robbed me of the fruit of my studies,
which has torn from me him whom I regarded as my
friend and father, to whom I was accustomed freely to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
communicate my cares, my thoughts, my every word
and deed. Justly is this day to be lamented by me,
in which I have lost the consolation of my sorrows, the
alleviation of my griefs, and the firmest support of my
labours. No longer shall I be permitted to converse
with thee, to ask thy advice, to rely upon thy friendly
exertions. This consolation I will, however, retain;
I will recall the memory of past times, and whilst I
imbibe the vital air, I will dwell on thy sweet remembrance,
and embrace thee in idea. The image of my
friend shall be perpetually present to my eyes; and since
alas! he is numbered amongst the silent dead, in the
celebration of his virtues I will testify the gratitude
which I feel for the numerous acts of kindness which I
have experienced from him during his life.”<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<p>The generality of scholars are not, perhaps, aware of
the debt of gratitude which they owe to Niccolo Niccoli.
If, however, they derive pleasure and improvement from
the perusal of the classic authors of Greece and Rome,
they ought to hold him in respectful remembrance; for to
his liberality and to his industry, the recovery and diffusion
of many of the writings of the ancients may be justly
ascribed. His pecuniary assistance enabled Poggio to
support the expenses which he incurred in the course of his
researches after neglected manuscripts; his assiduous diligence
in transcribing the works of the luminaries of Grecian
and Roman literature multiplied the copies of those exemplars<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
of true taste.<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> In the acquisition of books, he set
no bounds to his expenses; and the inconsiderateness of
the zeal with which he added to the stores of his library
sometimes reduced him to the verge of poverty.<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> His
researches after the memorials of ancient genius were not
confined to manuscripts. Inspired by a love of the arts,
he eagerly availed himself of every opportunity which
occurred, of purchasing antique statues, coins and gems.
So extensive was his collection of these interesting relics of
past magnificence, that Poggio asserts in his funeral oration,
that it exceeded the aggregate amount of all other collections
of the same kind.<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> He did not, like a literary miser,
morosely brood over the treasures of his library and his
cabinet in unsocial selfishness. His doors were always
open to the learned, and to those who entertained a desire
to improve their understanding by study. The ingenuous
youths who wished to gain access to the fountains of
knowledge found in Niccolo a protector and a guide.
Extending his patronage of literature beyond the period of
his mortal existence, by his last will he bequeathed his
library, which consisted of upwards of eight hundred
volumes, to the use of the public.<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span></p>

<p>It does not appear that he was the author of any
literary work, except a short treatise on the orthography of
the Latin language, in which he attempted to settle various
disputed points on this subject, by the authority of ancient
inscriptions.<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> One of his contemporaries<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> attributes his
literary silence to the fastidiousness of his taste, which led
him to form in his own mind a standard of excellence, to
which he despaired of attaining in the practice of Latin
composition. Leonardo Aretino, in the irritation of his
mind, occasioned by his unfortunate quarrel with Niccolo,
ascribed his declining to appear in the republic of letters, in
the character of an author, to his utter ignorance of the Latin
language.<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> But this is undoubtedly one of those calumnies
in which the scholars of that age indulged their
spleen, without feeling the slightest compunction of conscience.
To say nothing of the commendations of the
literary acquirements of Niccolo, which occur in the
writings of his learned contemporaries, his ample library
may be regarded as an evidence of his scholarship. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
modern times, the possession of an extensive and valuable
collection of books is not of itself a certain proof
of learning. But when it is considered that Niccolo had
himself transcribed many of the volumes which adorned the
shelves of his library, and that in the copies which he made
of the Roman classics he divided the respective subjects
into chapters, and prefixed to these divisions an abstract of
their contents—what reason can there be to entertain doubts
of his literary abilities? Several of the ancient writings
recovered by Poggio abounded in errors, which Niccolo corrected
in his transcripts; and he was accustomed to settle the
text of the Latin authors by the comparison of various
manuscripts. The execution of this task required considerable
learning, and in its performance he appears in the
venerable character of the parent of the useful art of verbal
criticism.<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>Restricting himself to the discharge of the higher<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
duties of benevolence, in the conferring of important
favours, Niccolo unfortunately neglected those lesser offices
of good will, which, though apparently trifling when considered
individually, have in the aggregate a considerable
influence upon the comfort and happiness of human life.
He was prone to anger, quick in finding fault, and prompt
in giving utterance to his resentful feelings.<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> United with
such a disposition, the possession of the dangerous faculty
of sarcastic wit was to Niccolo a most serious misfortune;<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>
as it too frequently betrayed him into that provoking
intemperance of speech which called into exercise the
forbearance of his friends, and excited the bitter enmity of
those whose pride or passion would not permit them
occasionally to give way to his sallies of peevishness. In
consequence of the indulgence of his ill humour, the
honour which accrued to him from his exertions to induce
Manuel Crysoloras and Guarino Veronese to instruct the
ingenuous youth of Florence in the Greek language, is
tarnished by his quarrels with those eminent scholars,
which, it is alleged, caused them to quit the Tuscan
capital in disgust. But if he was impetuous in his passion,
he was open to a conviction of his error, and listened with
patience to the admonitions of friendship. Those who
were intimately acquainted with his character pardoned his
occasional fits of moroseness, in consideration of the intrinsic
generosity of his heart. Niccolo was of a middling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
stature, inclined to corpulency, and in his countenance
there appeared a happy mixture of cheerfulness and gravity.
His bodily senses were remarkably acute, and he had cultivated
them to a degree of fastidiousness.<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> He was
splendid in his dress; but this was the extent of his luxury.
His hall was not crowded by a numerous retinue of servants.
Contented with the ministration of Benvenuta alone, he
did not profess to astonish and gratify his visitors by the
magnificence of sumptuous banquets; but in his instructive
conversation, and in the perusal of the classic volumes
which adorned his library, his literary friends enjoyed that
feast of reason which they could not meet with in more
superb abodes.</p>

<p>Whilst the pontiff was guarding his interests in Italy,
the council of Basil was studiously employed in driving
him to extremity. The decrees of that assembly, whereby
the payment of annates into the pontifical treasury was
prohibited, and the positive restrictions which it had imposed
upon the head of the church in the distribution of the
temporal powers and honours attached to the holy see, compelled
Eugenius to adopt decisive measures. Setting the
council at defiance, he continued to levy the taxes upon
ecclesiastical promotions, which had been so expressly condemned
as simoniacal, and deprived of their benefices all
those who, in compliance with its requisitions, refused to
pay the sums which he demanded as his due. In the continuance
of his nearest relatives in places of power and
trust, he evinced a similar contempt of the ordinances of
the synod. Irritated by these acts of contumacy, the
assembled fathers, on the thirty-first day of July, 1437,
formally impeached the pontiff as obstinately impeding the
desired reformation of the church—as violating the ecclesiastical
constitutions—as guilty of the scandalous offence of
selling benefices to the highest bidder, and bestowing them
on unworthy candidates, in compliance with the desire of
powerful men. After reciting these and various other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
heads of accusation against him, they summoned Eugenius
to appear and answer for himself within the space of sixty
days, under pain of incurring such penalties as the council,
in case of his refusing to comply with its requisitions,
should think fit to impose upon him.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>

<p>Far from being intimidated by these menaces, Eugenius,
in full consistory held at Bologna, issued a bull,
whereby he transferred the council from Basil to Florence.
On the twenty-sixth day of September, the fathers of Basil,
by a formal act, declared this proceeding of the pontiff null
and void;<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> and on the first of October they again summoned
Eugenius to appear and plead to the charges which
had been exhibited against him; and on his failing to appear,
either in person or by proxy, they pronounced him
contumacious, and unanimously decreed that he should be
proceeded against accordingly.<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> The pontiff having issued
a second bull, summoning the representatives of the Christian
community to Ferrara, for the purpose of effecting an
union between the Latin and the Greek churches, the council,
on the twelfth of October, prohibited all ecclesiastics,
under pain of excommunication, from yielding obedience to
the mandate of their spiritual sovereign.<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span></p>

<p>In the prosecution of these violent measures, the
council was encouraged by Alfonso of Arragon. This
prince was highly incensed against Eugenius, who had not
only refused to bestow upon him the investiture of the
kingdom of Naples, but had supported the claim of his
competitor, the duke of Anjou, by sending Vitelleschi to
his assistance at the head of a considerable army. Though
the warlike patriarch did not conduct this expedition with
his wonted success, the pontiff had, by thus imprudently
interfering in the affairs of the kingdom of Naples, given
great offence to the Arragonese monarch, who was naturally
impelled to countenance the proceedings of an assembly
which was labouring to repress the power of his adversary.<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p>The intrigues of Alfonso did not, however, deter
Eugenius from maintaining his spiritual authority. On the
eighth day of January, 1438, the council of Ferrara was,
according to the tenor of his bull, opened with the customary
solemnities.<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> When a sufficient number of the
ecclesiastics were assembled to give dignity and authority
to the proceedings of this new synod, he left Bologna, and
repaired in person to Ferrara, at which city he arrived on
the twenty-seventh day of January.<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<p>The reconciliation of the Latin and Greek churches
had, for many centuries, been a subject of earnest desire<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
to the zealous advocates for an uniformity of faith amongst
Christians. Whilst the Greeks possessed the shadow of
independence, their acuteness in disputation was by no means
inferior to the polemic ability of their antagonists; and
they strenuously persisted in maintaining the dogmas in
which they differed from the creed of their Latin brethren.
But terror frequently produces docility. The emperor
John Palæologus II. alarmed by the growing power of the
Turks, which threatened his dominions with devastation
and ruin, was induced to hope, that if he could by a
personal conference accommodate his religious differences
with the representatives of the Latin church, the European
powers might be persuaded to lend him effectual assistance
against the hostile attacks of the common enemy of the
Christian name. When the members of the council of
Basil were apprised of the conciliatory disposition of the
Grecian monarch, they immediately issued a decree, whereby
they engaged to pay the expenses which he should incur
on his voyage to Italy, and during his residence in that
country; and moreover undertook to maintain seven hundred
persons of his retinue, including the ecclesiastics
whom he might select to participate in their deliberations.<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>
When Eugenius had determined to hold a counter synod at
Ferrara, he was well aware that the Greeks would add
considerable weight to the assembly which they should
resolve to countenance by their presence. He accordingly
sent a sufficient number of galleys to transport Palæologus
and his attendants, and, at the same time, transmitted to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
the Grecian monarch a considerable sum of money to
enable him to make his appearance in Italy with a degree
of splendour suitable to his exalted station. Palæologus,
from the prejudices of royalty more disposed to accept the
invitation of the sovereign pontiff than that of an ecclesiastical
senate, embarked in the papal galleys, and arrived on
the eighth day of February, 1438, at Venice, where he
was received with the most flattering testimonies of respect.
On the fourth of March ensuing, he made his public entry
into Ferrara.<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> The ceremonials used upon this occasion
were wisely adapted to flatter the pride of the emperor, and
to dissipate the jealousy which he might be presumed to
entertain of the pretensions of the bishop of Rome.
When he arrived at the pontifical residence, Eugenius
advanced to meet him at the door of his apartment,
declined receiving from him any mark of distinctive homage,
and conducted him to a seat on his left hand. The same
discretion was manifested in settling the arrangements of
the council, where the Greek ecclesiastics were received
with all due honour and respect. The proceedings of that
assembly were by no means rapid. After the first session,
it entered upon no public acts for the space of six months.
At the end of that time, the plague having made its
appearance at Ferrara, and the near approach of the
pontiff’s inveterate enemy Piccinino, who had taken the
cities of Bologna, Imola, and Ravenna,<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> exciting the
fears of its leading members, Eugenius transferred the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
orthodox synod to Florence, at which city he arrived
on the 24th day of January, 1439. His departure
from Ferrara was so precipitate, that it might justly
be denominated a flight; and in order to avoid the soldiers
of Piccinino, he was compelled to take a circuitous
route by Modena, and through the passes of the Pistoian
mountains. He was soon followed by Palæologus and the
deputies of the Greek church, together with the other members
of the council.<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> Nothing of importance occurred in
the deliberations of that assembly till the sixth day of July.<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>
On this memorable day, the great work of the union of the
Latin and Greek churches was in appearance completed, by
the assent of the Grecian deputies to a decree, whereby the
disputed points, the discussion of which had for so long a
space of time excited discord between the two grand divisions
of the Christian community, were decided by the
concurrence of the highest authorities. The points in question
were, 1st. Whether leavened or unleavened bread
should be used in the communion of the body of Christ.
2nd. Whether the souls who dwelt in purgatory were purified
by elemental fire. 3rd. Whether the bishop of Rome was
the supreme head of the church: and 4th. Whether the
Holy Spirit proceeded from the Father and the Son, or from
the Father only. On the three first of these questions the
Greeks assented without any pertinacity of opposition to
the dogmas of their Latin brethren. The fourth afforded
matter of acute and lengthened disputation, and the subjugation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
of the prejudices of the learned ecclesiastics of
Constantinople called forth not only the polemic skill of
the most irrefragable doctors of the Latin church, but also
the political talents of the ablest negotiators of the Roman
court. Vanquished by intrigue rather than by argument,
persuaded rather than convinced, the attendants of Palæologus,
with the exception of two obstinate theologians,
at length concurred in the decree which announced to the
Christian world, that the word <i>filioque</i> was legally inserted in
the Nicene creed, that there is a purgatory of fire, and that
the body of Christ is to be made of unleavened bread.<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>
This decree having been solemnly promulgated, the Greeks
quitted Florence on the 26th day of August, and returned
to Constantinople.</p>

<p>Whilst the council was sitting at Ferrara, the cause of
decency and morality was vindicated by the passing of a
solemn censure upon a collection of epigrams entitled Hermaphroditus,
which was ignominiously consigned to the
flames in the most public part of the city. The author of
this publication, which exceeds the grossest effusions of
heathenism in the rankness of obscenity, was Antonio Beccatelli,
a native of Palermo, from which circumstance he is
commonly distinguished by the appellation of Panormita.
Beccatelli was born in the year 1394, of an ancient and
honourable family.<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> When he had finished his studies in
the university of Pavia, he entered into the service of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
Filippo Maria, duke of Milan, who studied history under
his instructions, for which he liberally requited him, by the
payment of an annual stipend of eight hundred crowns of
gold.<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> Being wearied by the distractions occasioned by the
frequent wars which disturbed the peace of Lombardy,
Beccatelli quitted Milan some time between the years 1432
and 1436, with the intention of residing in his native city.
He did not, however, long continue in retirement; for the
fame of his wit and learning having reached Alfonso, king
of Naples, that liberal prince invited him to his court,
bestowed upon him the honourable office of private secretary,
and treated him with the most distinguished regard. He
continued to occupy stations of the highest eminence under
Alfonso and his successors till the time of his death, which
event took place on the 6th of January, 1471.<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p>The Hermaphroditus of Beccatelli is dedicated to
Cosmo de’ Medici. A copy of this work was communicated
to Poggio, who was so much scandalized by its obscenity,
that he wrote to Beccatelli a friendly letter, in which he
highly commended the elegance of his style, but exhorted
him to be in future more delicate in the choice of his subjects.
“I am bound,” said he, “by the obligation of mutual
affection, which is imposed upon us all, to admonish you
to turn your attention to graver topics.</p>

<p>“The licence which is allowed to youth may be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
pleaded in excuse of the indelicacy of your late publication,
and you can indeed allege in your defence the
example of Virgil, and of other writers. But it is now
incumbent upon you to have done with lasciviousness, and
to apply yourself to severer studies, lest your moral character
should be estimated by the impurity of your writings.
You know, that we who profess ourselves Christians cannot
claim the same indulgences as those who were ignorant
of their duty. But I am in all probability teaching one
who is wiser then myself. I am persuaded, that on this
subject you agree with me in opinion.”<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

<p>To this salutary admonition Beccatelli replied in a
long epistle, in which he endeavoured to extenuate his
fault, by quoting as precedents the occasional pruriences
of composition of a long list of ancient poets and philosophers.
He also attempted to vindicate himself by a few
sophistical arguments.<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> His reasoning was easily confuted
by Poggio, who in a second letter examined with laudable
acuteness his precedents and arguments, and fully demonstrated
their insufficiency to vindicate the licentiousness
of imagery which disgusted every modest reader, whose
eyes happened to glance upon the impure pages of the
Hermaphroditus.<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span></p>

<p>Whilst Eugenius was thus employed in subduing the
heresy of the east, he laboured under the high displeasure
of the synod of Basil. After a repetition of the various
processes which had been issued against him when he
first refused to acknowledge their authority, the rebellious
fathers proceeded on the twenty-fifth of June, 1439, to
depose him from his pontifical honours. In the act of
deposition which they passed against him, they impeached
him of contumacy and disobedience to the commands of
the church—they declared that he was a violator of the
canons, a disturber of unity, guilty of simony and perjury.
They furthermore denounced him as an incorrigible
schismatic and heretic, and a destroyer of the rights and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
possessions of the church.<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> On the fifth of November,
1439, they filled up the measure of their offences by
electing Amedeus, duke of Savoy, to the pontifical chair.<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>
Amedeus, wearied by the cares of government, had lately
resigned the ducal sceptre to his eldest son, and had withdrawn
to the hermitage of Ripaille, a tranquil spot delightfully
situated on the southern side of the lake of Geneva,
where he proposed to dedicate the remainder of his days to
devout meditation and prayer. When the intelligence of
his election to the pontificate was announced to him, he
lamented the severity of his destiny, which summoned him
again to mingle in the cares and temptations of a wicked
world: but either seduced by the charms of pontifical
authority, or regarding the voice of the representatives of
the Christian community as the voice of God, he repaired
to Basil, where the ceremony of his coronation was performed
with studied magnificence, on the twenty-fourth of
July, 1440.<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>

<p>In the course of this contest between the councils of
Ferrara and of Basil, Eugenius derived considerable assistance
from the advice and support of Cardinal Julian, who,
being at length convinced by experience of the numerous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
evils arising from the precipitancy of the German synod, of
the probable occurrence of which he had been forewarned
by Poggio, had withdrawn from Basil, and by timely submission
had easily made his peace with his offended master.<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>
The conversion of Julian was promoted by the
assiduous endeavours of Ambrogio Traversari. Before his
accession to the pontifical throne, Eugenius had honourably
distinguished this learned ecclesiastic by his friendship, and
he did not forget him in the hour of his exaltation. The
general of the order of Camaldoli, who was impeached of
various evil practices, having resigned his office, Ambrogio
was, by the influence of the pontiff, appointed to succeed
him on the 26th day of October, 1431.<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> Inspired with
gratitude for this act of friendship, he readily undertook
the office of watching over the interests of his benefactor
at the council of Basil, which he was deputed to attend, as
the representative of the city of Florence.<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> In combating
the enemies of the pontiff in that seditious, but enlightened
assembly, he manifested a high degree both of spirit and
ability. His residence at Basil was however but of short
duration. Before the expiration of three months after his
arrival in that city, he was despatched by Eugenius into
Germany, with instructions to use his utmost endeavours to
detach the emperor Sigismund from the interests of the
council. Having executed this important commission with
more fidelity than success, in the spring of the year 1436<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
he returned to Florence, where he strove to forget the intrigues
of courts and synods in the discharge of the duties
of his office, and in the resumption of his studies. In the
year 1438, he was again summoned from retirement, to
engage in the violence of theological disputation. The
pontiff having had sufficient experience of his skill in conducting
affairs of the greatest moment, delegated to him
the important office of opening the council of Ferrara.<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> In
the minute and delicate discussions of doctrinal points
which took place in this assembly he bore a distinguished
part. On this occasion he signalized his knowledge of the
Greek language, by frequently acting as interpreter between
the respective representatives of the eastern and western
churches;<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> and it has been asserted, that his skill in intrigue
was not less conducive than his acuteness in disputation
to the settlement of the doctrine of the double procession.<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>
Ambrogio did not long survive the accomplishment
of this pious work. When the reconciliation of the
Greek and Latin churches had been effected, he once more
retired to the tranquillity of his monastery, where he died
on the 20th of November, 1439. His remains were first
deposited in the abbey of St. Salvadore in Camaldoli, and
were afterwards transferred to a religious retreat belonging
to his order, situated in the district of Casentino. The
writings of more than one of his contemporaries make mention
of a common report, that lilies grew upon his grave in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
the depth of winter, and that when these miraculous flowers
were with pious wonder gathered by his surviving brethren,
their place was immediately supplied by the production of
successive harvests.<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> Though the testimony of these witnesses
may, in an age of scepticism, be deemed insufficient
to establish the belief of this marvellous tale, the circulation
of such a report evinces the celebrity of Ambrogio’s fame,
and the opinion which was generally entertained of the
extraordinary sanctity of his life.</p>

<p>Ambrogio Traversari is justly regarded as one of the
literary luminaries of his age. His knowledge was various
and profound. He was well versed in the Hebrew scriptures.
It has been before observed, that the conferences
which took place between the deputies of the Latin and
Greek churches in the council of Ferrara, gave him an
opportunity of displaying the uncommon proficiency which
he had made in the Grecian language. Rendering his
literary acquirements subservient to the duties of his profession,
he dedicated a considerable portion of his time to
the translation of the Greek fathers. Diogenes Laertius
is the only profane author whose works he illustrated by a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
Latin version. His style is flowing, but so unpolished,
that he seems to have fallen into the erroneous opinion,
that an attention to the elegancies of composition is unbecoming
those who are dedicated to sacred offices. His
manners appear to have been simple, and his dispositions
benevolent. With his learned contemporaries he maintained
an extensive correspondence. A large collection of
his letters was published by P. Martene in the third volume
of his Ancient Monuments. This collection was afterwards
republished, with several additions, by P. Canetti; and
lastly, the Abate Mehus, in two splendid folio volumes,
printed at Florence in the year 1759, has favoured the
public with a very correct impression of Ambrogio’s epistles
and orations, to which he has prefixed a most elaborate
history of his life, and of the revival of literature in Florence.
These epistles, and the Hodœporicon, or journal
kept by Traversari of the observations which he made in
the course of several journeys which he took to various parts
of Italy, after his elevation to the generalship of his order,
afford much curious information concerning the manners and
customs of the times in which he lived.</p>

<p>With Poggio, Ambrogio maintained the most familiar
intimacy. The friendship of these industrious revivers of
literature originated in the community of their studies, and
was confirmed by mutual acts of good will. But the jealousy
with which Poggio regarded the whole body of monks led
him to suspect, that Ambrogio, after his advancement to the
generalship of his order, divested himself of that simplicity
and singleness of heart which may be reasonably expected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
from those who make a profession of extraordinary sanctity,
and that he disguised the selfishness of ambition in the garb
of pretended humility.<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> This suspicion, however, he advanced
with becoming doubt; and perhaps justice to Ambrogio
might trace its origin to that superior gravity which he
might think it incumbent upon himself to assume, when he
was called to fill offices of high dignity, and which might
sometimes restrain that familiarity with which he was accustomed
to converse with Poggio and his other friends,
when he dwelt, in cloistered seclusion, a simple monk of
Camaldoli.</p>

<p>Whilst Ambrogio was employed at Ferrara in the
correction of creeds, and the conversion of heretics, Poggio
was occupied by domestic cares in the retirement of his
Tuscan villa. In the year 1438 his wife presented him
with a son, to whom he gave the name of Pietro Paulo.
Amongst the number of his friends who congratulated him
on this event was Cincio, one of the apostolic secretaries,
a descendant of the noble Roman family of Rustica.<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>
Monsieur L’Enfant has published the letter which Cincio
wrote on this occasion, wherein he intimates to Poggio
his firm persuasion, that this child, being the offspring of
a man of consummate learning, and of a mother descended
from an honourable family, will be naturally inclined to
every thing excellent and praise-worthy. In the prospect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>
of his being educated at Florence, also, he finds a presage
of his future attainments in knowledge and in virtue.
Anxious for the welfare of an infant born under such happy
auspices, he admonishes his friend, that should any consideration
induce him to prohibit Vaggia from performing
the first duty of a mother, it would be incumbent upon
him to be fastidiously careful in the choice of a nurse.
“Let her be,” says he, “a woman of a robust constitution,
of good complexion, as well as of a good disposition,
and also of ingenuous manners; for nurses have a wonderful
influence in forming the habits of children.” He
then exhorts Poggio assiduously to watch over the progress
of his son’s understanding, and to inculcate upon him
lessons of the strictest temperance. After having enlarged
upon these topics, he concludes in the following terms:—“Lastly,
I must inform you, that your presence is very
earnestly desired in the Roman court. Come, then, and
we will celebrate the birth of your son in a friendly
festival. You shall be the master of the feast, and you
shall have the honour of entertaining as your guests a
number of Latin and Greek philosophers. We will
converse upon a variety of topics, particularly upon the
nature of pleasure. The exquisiteness of the dishes,
and the excellence of the wine, will ensure the alluring
goddess abundance of advocates. Even I, who have
just been vilifying her, as not to be tolerated in human
society, may possibly on this occasion once more enter
into her good graces.”<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> In reply to this friendly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
epistle, Poggio assured Cincio that in the choice of a
nurse for his infant son, he had paid due regard to the
qualities enumerated by him, and that he would spare no
pains in his education; but at the same time, in opposition
to the opinion of his correspondent, he maintained by
many arguments, and by examples of great weight, that
education is of little avail in the formation of character,
independently of a naturally good disposition of mind.<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

<p>During the time when the domestic concerns of Poggio
caused him to be absent from the pontifical court, the list
of his correspondents was enlarged by the name of a
sovereign prince, who occupied the foremost rank amongst
the potentates of Italy, namely Filippo Maria, duke of
Milan. This restless chieftain had in the year 1436
renewed hostilities against the Florentines, in contempt of
the pacification which had been concluded at Ferrara, only
three years before that period. This war was not, however,
of long duration. The Florentines, being dissatisfied with
the conduct of the Venetians, their allies, concluded a
separate peace with the duke on very advantageous terms,
in the year 1438.</p>

<p>The alliance between the Florentines and the Venetians
had always been a most formidable obstacle to the
ambitious projects of Filippo, and he had nothing more at
heart than to create a jealousy between those two republics.
It was probably with a view of engaging the party of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span>
the Medici in his interest, that soon after the conclusion
of the above-mentioned peace, he addressed to Poggio a
long epistle, in which he artfully attempted to gratify his
well known enthusiastic love of his native country, by a
studied eulogium on the Florentine state, and also endeavoured
to conciliate his favour, by assuring him that he had
always entertained the highest respect for his personal qualities
and his literary attainments. It appears from the commencement
of Filippo’s letter, that some persons having
stigmatized the Florentines as a short-sighted people, Poggio
had remarked that the duke of Milan was well qualified
to prove the contrary.<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> The duke, affecting not to be sensible
of the sarcasm couched in this observation, professed
to be greatly flattered by the high opinion which Poggio
appeared to entertain of his talents; and commending the
zeal which he manifested in defending the reputation of his
country, declared, that so far from finding the Florentines
short-sighted, he had always witnessed their skill, their prudence,
and their sagacity. The valour of the Tuscans, he
observed, his ancestors had experienced to their cost. Nor
was he himself insensible of the power of their arms, or of
the wisdom of their councils. In the late war they had so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span>
skilfully and courageously frustrated his hostile attempts,
that they had proved themselves truly worthy of the
blessings of freedom. Nor were the Florentines less
accomplished in the arts of peace than in those of war.
Their moderation was universally acknowledged. By
their patronage of the liberal sciences they had acquired
an honourable distinction amongst the states of Italy. A
people of this character, Filippo observed, he could not
but esteem and love; and he protested that he would
henceforth be as assiduous in cultivating their friendship,
as he had lately been active in troubling their repose.
He advised Poggio to treat the malevolent speeches of
calumniators with contempt; and at the close of his
epistle, he assured him that he would always be ready
to exert his power and abilities to promote the welfare
of the Tuscan republic.</p>

<p>In his answer to this extraordinary letter, Poggio
expressed the grateful sense which he entertained of the
polite condescension manifested by the duke, in thus
honouring a private and obscure individual with his unsolicited
correspondence. He assured Filippo that he
was highly gratified by the flattering terms in which he
had complimented him on his literary attainments, but
yet more by the eulogium which he had pronounced upon
the city of Florence, and by the pledge which he had
given of his friendship for the Tuscan state. He then
expressed his hope, and indeed his confidence, that the
pacific professions of the duke would not be found fallacious,
but that his actions would prove the sincerity of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span>
his declarations. Proceeding to remind him of different
conjunctures in which the Florentines had testified their
good will towards him, he observed to his illustrious correspondent,
that whenever the administrators of the Tuscan
republic had engaged in hostilities against him, they
had not been prompted to take up arms by the ambitious
hope of extending their territories, but by a determination
to defend their liberties. “And if,” said he,
“liberty ought to be dear to any people, it ought to be
dear to the Florentines; for freedom is the very
essence of our constitution. We are not ruled by the
arbitrary will of an individual, nor by a faction of
nobles. The mass of the people enjoy an equality
of rights, and the way to civic honours is open to
all. Hence it happens, that the high and the low,
the noble and the ignoble, the rich and the poor,
unite in the defence of their common freedom, and
that in so glorious a cause they spare no expense,
shrink from no labour, and dread no danger.” Poggio
then proceeded to express his persuasion, that in
the wars in which the duke had engaged against the
Florentine state, he had imagined that he was fighting
in defence of his honour and glory; for it was not
to be supposed, that so generous a prince could for a
moment entertain the unworthy desire to oppress a republic,
whose power and splendour, the consequences of
its free constitution, were the pride of Italy. Nothing,
he assured the duke, could be more grateful to his
feelings, than the friendly dispositions towards his countrymen
announced in his letter, which he fondly regarded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span>
as the herald of a lasting peace. “Peace,” said he, “I
must always regard as preferable to war—provided it
be not the cloak of insidious stratagem. You see,”
continued Poggio, “that your condescension encourages
me to express my sentiments with the utmost freedom.
At the same time do not imagine that I mean to insinuate
any doubt of your sincerity. I am confident
that your well known wisdom will prompt you to lay
the foundations of a firm and lasting friendship, which
will be mutually advantageous to yourself and to the
Florentine state. Let this be your conduct, and you
will find me a joyful herald of your praise; and inconsiderable
as my talents may be, my efforts will be
the means of exciting others, whose abilities will do
ample justice to your merits.”<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>

<p>If it was the intention of the duke of Milan, by
thus honouring Poggio with the offer of his friendship,
to make an experiment upon his vanity, the tenor of the
foregoing answer to his condescending epistle must have
convinced him that his experiment had entirely failed.
Divesting himself of the humility of the papal secretary,
Poggio addressed his illustrious correspondent with the
firm ingenuousness of a citizen of a free state. He pleaded
the cause of his country with all the energy of liberty;
and though he prudently smoothed the harshness of distrust
by the polish of urbanity, the penetration of Filippo<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span>
would easily discern, that he was far from giving implicit
credit to his professions of friendship for the Florentine
republic.</p>

<p>Whatever might be the views of the duke in this
affair, not many months had elapsed after the occurrence
of this interchange of suspicious civility, before he found
that the privileged walls of the palace of Milan could not
protect a literary delinquent from the rage of scholastic
vengeance; and that the interposition of his patronage
could not deter Poggio from reiterating his attacks upon
Francesco Filelfo. It has been already related, that this
wandering professor, when he was compelled to fly from
Florence, withdrew to Siena, where he arrived early in
the year 1435. In this city he commenced a series of
lectures on rhetoric, for which he was remunerated by
the payment of an annual salary of three hundred and
fifty gold crowns.<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> His literary labours were however
disturbed by the apprehensions which he entertained of
the machinations of his adversaries. But his fears for
his personal safety did not restrain the intemperance of
his pen. On the thirteenth of August, 1437, he transmitted
to one of his friends, named Pietro Pierleoni, a
new satire against Poggio and Cosmo de’ Medici. Soon
after the publication of this satire, he visited the baths
of Petriolæ, where he had not long resided before he
received a letter from Siena, informing him that a man
of a very suspicious appearance had been making minute<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span>
inquiries into his present situation and habits of life.
On the receipt of this letter Filelfo returned to Siena,
where he soon recognized in the person in question,
the ruffian who had formerly made an attack upon him
in the streets of Florence. He immediately gave the
necessary information to the captain of the city guard.
This officer without loss of time apprehended the villain,
from whom, according to the barbarous practice of the
times, he endeavoured to extract a declaration of the
object of his visit to Siena by the pains of the rack.
By this uncertain mode of investigation, the prisoner
was compelled to confess, that he came to that city for
the purpose of assassinating Filelfo. The captain of the
guard did not deem it necessary to inquire whether any
person had suborned him to perpetrate so execrable a
deed; but the ready conjecture of Filelfo fixed upon
the Medici an imputation, which a direct interrogatory
ably introduced on a new distension of his sinews, would
have induced the wretched Filippo to confirm by a judicial
declaration. An acknowledgment of guilt having been
thus extorted from the culprit, the captain of the guard
proceeded to condemn him to pay a fine of five hundred
pounds of silver. Filelfo, not satisfied with this penalty,
appealed to the governor of the city, who proceeding
upon his recorded confession, punished the offender by
cutting off his right hand. Nothing indeed but the
earnest request of Filelfo would have prevented the chief
magistrate from dooming the wretch to the punishment
of death. Filelfo was not, however, prompted by any
emotions of compassion to desire that the life of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span>
assassin might be prolonged. “I interfered to prevent
his execution,” said he, in a letter to Æneas Sylvius,
“because I wished that he should live mutilated and
disgraced, rather than that he should be freed by a
speedy death from the anguish of a suffering mind.
For as it is the duty of a man of a magnanimous spirit
to forgive slight offences, so justice and prudence require
us to inflict vengeance on a common enemy of the
human race.”<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> Filelfo was so much alarmed by the
appearance of the Tuscan bravo, that he did not deem
himself secure in the precincts of Siena. He accordingly
returned from thence to Bologna.<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> After a short residence
in that place, in the month of May, 1439, he repaired to
Milan, to which city he was attracted by the munificence
of the duke.<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> Encouraged by the protection of this
powerful patron, he exulted in his security, and proudly
bade defiance to his enemies. Mistaking the emotions of
wrath for the inspiration of the muse, he poured forth
torrent after torrent of abusive verses. Ringing over and
over again the changes of virulent scurrility, he renewed
his attack upon the person and reputation of Poggio.
The vengeance of Poggio was not long dormant. He
moved to the combat with the cumbrous artillery of a
long invective, in which he continued his invidious strictures
on the life and conversation of his adversary.
Adverting in the beginning of this composition to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span>
scandalous imputations which had been aimed at him by
Filelfo, he thus compared his own history with that of
his antagonist. “Of myself I shall only say, that in
consequence of these crimes which you impute to me,
I have lived with honour and dignity in the service of
seven successive pontiffs, from whom I have experienced
the most satisfactory proofs of their kind regard; whilst
you, adorned as you represent yourself to be with
virtues, have been wandering about like a Scythian
flying from city to city; oppressed with poverty, continually
reduced to the necessity of suing for foreign
aid, never able to retain a fixed habitation for any length
of time; but, like a harpy, spreading such a foul contagion
wherever you come, that they who afforded you
an asylum were soon compelled to banish you.”<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>—Upbraiding
his antagonist with the obscurity of his origin,
Poggio affirmed that he was the offspring of an adulterous
intercourse between a parish priest and the wife of a
rustic, whose hands, he said, were so rough with continual
labour, that he was accustomed to use them instead of
a curry comb in dressing his horses.<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> Tracing the course
of Filelfo’s early life, he noticed his residence in Padua,
and his visit to Venice and Constantinople, from all
which places he affirmed that he was driven by the infamy
of his vices. Narrating his transactions after his return
to Italy, he charged him with fraudulently retaining
certain books, in payment for which he had received sums<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span>
of money from Leonardo Giustiniano and Guarino Veronese.
He also enumerated many more instances of his
alleged dishonesty. Amongst other imputations of this
nature, he asserted, that Filelfo, being once admitted into
Leonardo Aretino’s library, took advantage of the absence
of his host to steal a box of gold rings. He reminded
him of the precipitancy of his flight from Florence, and
affirmed that he left Siena in disgrace, and fled to Milan
in circumstances of the utmost distress. Having exhausted
all the topics of obloquy which suggested themselves to
his fertile imagination, Poggio concluded his invective
with the following peroration. “Since you are conscious
that these things are true, I wonder that you do not
withdraw from the light, and fly from the aspect of men
into some distant solitudes, where the villany of Filelfo
is unknown. But your mind, delighting in wickedness and
blinded by passion, your obscene manners, your abandoned
life, your secret vices, hurry you headlong to your fate,
drive you onward by the instigation of the furies, prevent
you from profiting by wholesome counsel, and render you
insensible of the distinction between right and wrong.
As Hercules traversed the world to benefit mankind by
his labours, so you have visited every country and climate
to disgust them by your vices. Whither would you
betake yourself should you be deprived of the countenance
of your present patron? You have now wandered
like a common mendicant through every district of Italy.
What will you do if your present resources fail you?
Whose assistance will you implore? To whose protection
will you commend yourself? I know what you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span>
will do. You will enlist into some army; and, such is
your ambition, you will have the vanity to aspire to the
chief command. But you will make your exit at the
gallows—an exit well befitting a man of your vicious
character. For when your patron shall perceive that he
does not obtain praise, but ignominy from your ridiculous
writings his sentiments will be changed, and he will
drag you from your obscene retreat, and inflict upon you
the punishment due to your crimes.”<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<p>The exhibition of a few specimens of the virulence
which distinguished the hostility of these learned gladiators
is perhaps necessary to give a true idea of the character of
the combatants, and of the times in which they lived. It
may also be subservient to another useful purpose. The
odious nature of vice, as well as the beauty of virtue, is
most strikingly demonstrated by examples; and perhaps
nothing will tend more to convince men of the folly of
evil speaking, lying, and slandering, than the perusal of
the invectives of Poggio, and the satires of Filelfo.</p>

<p>Poggio did not, however, waste the whole of the leisure
time which he enjoyed in the retirement of his Tuscan
villa, in the disgraceful occupation of bestowing a literary
garb on the grossest abuse. At the commencement of the
year 1440 he published his dialogue on Nobility, a work
which greatly increased his reputation by the luminousness
of its method, the elegance of its diction, and the learned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span>
references with which it was interspersed. In a short
prefatory address, by which he dedicated this dialogue to
Gerardo Landriani, bishop of Como, he observed, that it
was a remarkable circumstance, that this subject, which
opened so wide a field for discussion, had been in a manner
neglected by the learned. He professed his conviction of
his own inability to do justice to it, but expressed his hopes
that his example might induce scholars of more brilliant
talents to correct his errors, and to supply his deficiencies.</p>

<p>The interlocutors of this dialogue are Niccolo Niccoli
and Lorenzo de’ Medici, the brother of Cosmo. The
scene of the conversation is laid in the villa of Poggio,
which these lovers of the fine arts had visited for the
purpose of inspecting some ancient statues which had been
lately conveyed thither from Rome. The sight of these
statues arranged in the garden of Poggio’s rural retreat
reminds Lorenzo of the manners of the ancient Romans,
who, he observes, were accustomed to adorn the halls of
their palaces with the effigies of their ancestors, the lustre
of whose nobility they imagined reflected honour on themselves.
This remark draws from Niccolo a declaration
of his opinion, that in founding their fame on the glory
of their progenitors, they were greatly deceived, as the
seat of true nobility is the mind. Lorenzo, granting the
position, that virtue is a source of nobility, affirms that
this honour may also be acquired by the ornaments of
wealth and dignity. In proof of his assertion, he enlarges
on the meaning of the word <i>nobilis</i>, shewing, by various
quotations from Latin authors, that it is used to signify in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span>
general the quality of being remarkable, without any
reference to the cause of notoriety. He moreover observes,
that the common opinion of men attaches the idea of
nobility to eminence of station, splendour of birth, and
other adventitious circumstances of a similar nature. Niccolo,
replying to this observation, that if the opinion of the
vulgar is to be regarded, their ideas are so various upon the
subject, that no certain criterion can be derived from them,
is desired to enumerate the characteristics of nobility which
occur in different countries. In compliance with this
request, he thus describes the nobles of his native land.
“To begin with the Italians, who have disseminated
amongst other nations the arts which adorn human life,
what a difference there subsists between the nobility of
Naples, of Venice, and of Rome. The Neapolitans,
who pride themselves on their patrician dignity, seem to
imagine, that nobility consists in the indulgence of idleness
and sloth; for they enter into no active pursuits,
but live in indolence upon the revenues of their estates.
They deem it unbecoming a nobleman to attend to agriculture,
or to take any cognizance of the state of his
affairs. They spend their time in loitering in the halls of
their palaces, or in equestrian exercises. However bad
a man’s moral character may be, or however mean his
talents, if he be descended from an ancient family, he
a ranks amongst the nobility. As to merchandize, they
regard it with contempt; and so ridiculous is their pride,
that though they be reduced to the most abject state of
poverty, they would rather starve than suffer any branch
of their family to form a matrimonial alliance with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span>
most opulent tradesman. Nay, so great is their dislike
of traffic, that they deem it more honourable to support
themselves by robbery, than to gain a livelihood by
engaging in any species of commerce. I know a Neapolitan
of a most illustrious family, who was regarded by
his brother patricians in so degrading a light, because he
had exposed to sale a quantity of wine, the produce of
his estates, that he experienced the utmost difficulty in
marrying his daughter, though he was able to bestow
upon her a very large fortune.</p>

<p>“To this absurdity the customs of the Venetians
afford a striking contrast. In their state the nobility
compose a kind of faction distinct from the body of
the people, and are all engaged in merchandize. All
those who have discharged public offices, and all the
members of the senate, are graced with the honours of
nobility. And so vain are they of this distinction,
that the foolish and needy son of a foolish and needy
father, looks down with disdain upon a plebeian, whatever
may be his learning or his worth. The ranks of the
Venetian nobility are sometimes recruited in an extraordinary
manner. For he who has done any signal
service to the state, however culpable may have been
the means of which he has made use to promote this end,
is immediately enrolled in the list of the patricians.</p>

<p>“The Roman nobles are taught to regard merchandize
as a sordid pursuit, and they employ themselves in
the cultivation of their lands, and in the breeding of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>[342]</span>
cattle. So far are they from thinking it beneath their
dignity to convert their agricultural knowledge into a
source of gain, that property thus acquired will raise
ignoble families to the honour of noble birth.</p>

<p>“The Florentines seem to have more correct notions
of nobility than any of the above-mentioned communities.
For amongst us those are accounted noble who are descended
from ancient families, and whose ancestors have
held distinguished places in the administration of public
affairs; but their nobility is by no means dependant upon
the nature of their occupation. For some of them engage
in merchandize; others live upon the income of their property,
and amuse themselves with the rural diversions of
hawking and hunting. The Genoese who live on the coast
are all indiscriminately engaged in commerce, and their
nobility depends upon their origin. The Lombard nobles
reside in fortresses built upon the mountains, and, by their
predatory excursions, strike terror into the traveller. The
nobility of the Terra Firma of Venice live on the revenue
of their estates, and spend their time in rural sports.
Amongst them, nobility depends upon high descent, and
independence of property. Why should I mention other
nations whose customs differ but little from our own?
The Germans esteem those noble who inherit a patrimony
sufficient for their maintenance; and they bestow this title
on those formidable plunderers who retire from towns and
cities to the security of their castles. Throughout the
whole of France the privilege of nobility is held by one
uniform tenure. The Gallic lords live in the country,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[343]</span>
and think it a disgrace for a man of exalted birth to reside
in a town. They despise merchants as a vile and abject
race of beings. Prodigality and carelessness with regard
to futurity they esteem a certain indication of a noble
spirit. The nobility of France is continually increased
by the accession either of the wealthy, or of the retainers
of the great barons. For the sons of merchants and
tradesmen who have inherited large fortunes from their
fathers, by purchasing an estate and living in the country
on its produce, compose an inferior order of nobility, and
transmit to their sons all the honours of the aristocracy:
and those who have lived in the service of the great barons,
by receiving from their liege lords a grant of land, attain
to the rank of nobility. The customs of the English are
in this respect very similar to those of the French. In
Spain nobility is attached to the descendants of ancient
houses who are possessed of competent property, whether
they reside in cities or in the country.”</p>

<p>Having thus noticed the different ideas of nobility
which are entertained in the European states, Niccolo proceeds
slightly to animadvert upon the notions of the Asiatics
upon this subject; and from this induction of particulars,
he draws the general inference, that nobility, in the vulgar
acceptation of the term, cannot be traced to any fixed principles.
On Lorenzo’s intimating that the title of noble
should be granted to all those who are esteemed so by the
institutions of their country, Niccolo refuses his assent to
this proposition, and proceeds to argue the matter at large
with much sound reasoning, proving that nobility does not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344"></a>[344]</span>
depend upon externals. Lorenzo in reply to Niccolo adduces
the definition of nobility proposed by Aristotle, who asserts
in his dialogue on Politics, that the virtuous descendants of
virtuous and wealthy ancestors are noble. This definition is
examined by Niccolo, who maintains that it is faulty, because
a virtuous man does not lose his nobility, should he
happen to be deprived of his wealth. In opposition to the
opinion of the Stagyrite, he quotes the opinion of Plato and
the Stoics, who assert, that true nobility consists in virtue.
Lorenzo acknowledges that virtue is requisite to true nobility;
but still contends that to complete the idea of this distinction,
to virtue must be added those external advantages
which render a man conspicuous. Niccolo grants that these
are desirable adjuncts; but at the same time adheres to his
original position, that purity of moral principle is an indispensable
characteristic of genuine nobility, and concludes
the conference by inviting the company to enjoy the coolness
of the evening in walking along the banks of the river.<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p>

<p>Though this dialogue on nobility was received with
great applause by the generality of learned men, the
description which it contained of the Venetian nobles
offended the patriotic pride of Gregorio Coriario, prothonotary
of the apostolic see, who remonstrated with Poggio on
the unfavourable light in which he had represented the
patricians of his country, as a kind of faction distinct from
the body of the people, and as being ready to confer the
highest civil honours on those who had served their country,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[345]</span>
even by dishonourable means. In reply to the animadversions
of Gregorio, Poggio expressed his wish that he had
communicated his dialogue to him previously to its publication,
declaring that he would with the utmost readiness
have altered or expunged any objectionable passage which
might have been pointed out to him. At the same time he
endeavoured to palliate the offence which he had committed
against the dignity of the Venetian aristocracy, by observing,
that he had adopted the word <i>factio</i> merely to express
the idea of a class or party of men, in which innocent or
indifferent sense it was used by the best Latin authors.
As to the second cause of displeasure, he protested that he
had made the obnoxious assertion in question upon what he
conceived to be good authority, and that he was persuaded
that the Venetians had sometimes conferred the honours
of nobility upon men of equivocal character. “You ask
me,” continued he, “to quote some instance of the
occurrence of this circumstance. Believe me, if I
recollected any I would rather acknowledge myself in an
error, than defend my cause at the expense of any one’s
good name. I wish my lucubrations to be favourably
received by the public. On this account it is much more
my interest to praise than to condemn. I therefore beg
that you will freely correct my mistakes, and do not fear
exciting my displeasure. I esteem myself greatly indebted
to you for that kindness which prompts you to be watchful
over my honour, and zealous to prevent me from
giving unnecessary offence. Nor must I forget to express
the sense which I feel of the modesty and urbanity which
render your letter the clear expression of the mildness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[346]</span>
and gentleness of your manners. <i>Florence, April 8th,
1440.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>

<p>By introducing Lorenzo de’ Medici as an interlocutor
in this dialogue, Poggio no doubt intended to preserve to
distant times the memory of the familiar terms on which
he had lived with one of the most illustrious citizens of
Florence.</p>

<p>Lorenzo did not long survive the publication of this
testimony of esteem. On the twenty-third of September,
1440, he paid the great debt of nature. In him Poggio
was at once deprived of a father, a brother, and a friend—of
one who was always ready to sympathize in his cares,
and to assist him in his distresses.<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> Whilst Lorenzo lived
he was free from anxiety with regard to pecuniary affairs,
as in his liberality he constantly found the most copious
resources in the hour of need. By the death of this
generous benefactor, he was deeply affected; and as soon
as his grief would permit him to collect his scattered
thoughts, he hastened to celebrate the virtues of his
deceased friend, in an eulogium on his character, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[347]</span>
he addressed to Carlo Aretino. From this effusion of
affectionate esteem, we learn that Lorenzo was endued with
the elegance of taste, the liberality of spirit, and the
urbanity of manners, which for so long a period distinguished
all the branches of his renowned family. His
kinsmen no doubt deemed his memory highly honoured by
the respectful attendance of Eugenius IV. at his funeral
obsequies.<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> But they were probably little aware, that the
duteous zeal of an humble secretary would be more conducive
to the diffusion and the permanence of his fame,
than the splendour of a pontifical procession, or the grandeur
of monumental memorials.</p>

<p>It has been already observed, that from the tenor of
Poggio’s answer to the complimentary letter of the duke
of Milan, he appears not to have given implicit credit to
that prince’s professions of friendship for the Florentine
republic, and that he evidently expected that the restless
ambition of Filippo would again kindle the flames of war.
Events justified his prognostications. In the year 1439,
the administrators of the Tuscan government were so much
alarmed by the success of Piccinino, who had invaded the
Venetian territories at the head of the Milanese army, that
they renewed their alliance with their ancient friends, to
whose assistance they sent a considerable body of troops,
under the command of Francesco Sforza. The duke of
Milan, with the view of compelling the Tuscans to withdraw
their forces from Lombardy, directed Piccinino to
make an incursion into the territories of Florence. Piccinino
accordingly marched through Romagna, and made
himself master of several places in the district of Casentino.
The duke of Milan expected to have derived considerable
assistance in the invasion of the Tuscan territories from
Vitelleschi, with whom he had for some time carried on a
secret correspondence, and who had, through hatred of the
Florentines, engaged to support Piccinino with a powerful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352"></a>[352]</span>
body of troops. But the secrecy with which this intrigue
had been conducted did not elude the vigilance of the
administrators of the Tuscan government. They fortunately
intercepted certain letters addressed by the duke
to Vitelleschi, which revealed the particulars of the conspiracy.
These letters they communicated to the pontiff,
who gave immediate orders for the arrest of the perfidious
patriarch. As Vitelleschi was then at Rome, the execution
of this commission was entrusted to Antonio Rido,
the commandant of the castle of St. Angelo. According
to the instructions of Eugenius, Vitelleschi was suddenly
surrounded by a troop of horse, as he was passing the
bridge of St. Angelo, on his way to join the forces which
he had destined for the assistance of Piccinino. He was
no sooner aware of his danger, than he boldly drew his
sword, and endeavoured to cut his way through the soldiers
who were sent to secure him. In the conflict he was
wounded in the neck, and growing faint with loss of blood,
he was overpowered and carried as a prisoner into the castle.
On the twentieth day of his confinement he died, as some
say of his wounds, according to the report of others, of
poison. By whatever means he came to his end, so
atrocious were the cruelties which he had committed during
the days of his power, that his death occasioned universal
joy, and was regarded by thousands as a signal instance of
divine retribution.<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[353]</span></p>

<p>Piccinino being by this event deprived of all hope of
assistance was obliged to depend upon his own exertions.
In these circumstances he was not dispirited. The successes
which he had experienced in the commencement of the
campaign led him to entertain sanguine hopes of crushing
the Tuscan republic. But his confidence prepared the way
for his discomfiture and disgrace. His rash reliance on the
valour and discipline of his troops tempting him to engage
the Florentine army under very disadvantageous circumstances,
he experienced a total defeat on the twenty-ninth
of June, 1440.<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> Nor did better success attend the arms of
the duke of Milan in Lombardy. His forces were put to
the rout by Francesco Sforza, on the banks of the river
Oglio. Disheartened by these losses, Filippo was disposed
to an accommodation; and by the mediation of Sforza,
peace was again concluded between that prince and his
allied enemies in the autumn of the year 1441.<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<p>In the preceding year, Niccolo d’Este, marquis of
Ferrara, had assiduously endeavoured to bring about this
desirable event; and though his mediation was unsuccessful,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[354]</span>
his friendly interposition served to confirm the honourable
character which he had so long sustained—that of the promoter
of peace. In such estimation did the duke of Milan
hold this virtuous prince, that he invited him to his capital,
and entrusted him with the government of his extensive
dominions. This mark of confidence was universally regarded
as a prelude to the nomination of Niccolo to the
ducal throne of Milan; but the hopes which the friends of
virtue entertained of witnessing the happy effects resulting
from his advancement were destroyed by his death, which
took place on the 26th of December, 1441.</p>

<p>The sorrow experienced by the subjects of Niccolo, in
consequence of this event, was considerably alleviated by
their observation of the extraordinary good qualities of
Lionello, his successor. In the contemplation of the purity
of morals, the solidity of judgment, and the benevolence
of heart, which adorned the character of this exemplary
youth, they forgot the illegitimacy of his birth; and when,
prompted by an enthusiastic respect for his virtues, they joyfully
hailed him as their sovereign, their choice was approved
by the suffrages of all the scholars of Italy. Lionello was
indeed the favourite theme of the applause of the learned.
He not only encouraged the ardour, but participated in the
studies of the cultivators of the liberal arts. Under the
auspices of Guarino Veronese, he had acquired a profound
knowledge of classical literature, which enabled him accurately
to appreciate the merits of the candidates for
literary fame. The promotion of Lionello to the sovereignty
of Ferrara was highly gratifying to the feelings of Poggio.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355"></a>[355]</span>
Several years previously to this event, he had been
induced by the fame of the elegance of taste which distinguished
Lionello’s juvenile compositions, to address to
him a letter, in which he highly commended his love of
literature, and strenuously exhorted him diligently to pursue
those studies which he had so happily begun.<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> The request
which he made to this illustrious student to prosecute an inquiry
after the lost decads of Livy has been already noticed.
The homage which Poggio paid to the talents of Lionello
gave rise to an epistolary intercourse, the refraining fragments
of which afford a striking specimen of the unreserved
friendship and liberal familiarity which a community of
studies sometimes produces between persons who occupy
very distant stations in the ranks of society. The freedom
with which Lionello permitted his learned correspondent to
communicate to him his opinions, is conspicuous in a letter
addressed by Poggio to Guarino Veronese, requesting him
to inform their patron of the surprize and concern which he
had experienced on receiving the intelligence of his having
bestowed some distinguished honours on an unworthy candidate.<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>
Of the character of this candidate Poggio gave
his sentiments in the following letter to Lionello himself,
which is interesting on account of the information which it
contains with respect to the value of books at this period.</p>

<p>“A few days ago there occurred in the chamber of his
holiness a discourse on the subject of Jerome’s epistles.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356"></a>[356]</span>
Happening to be present on this occasion, I observed,
that I had in my possession two very handsome volumes
of those epistles; on which one of the company remarked,
that he had offered me eighty florins for them, but could
not obtain them at that price. To this I replied, that the
cardinal of St. Xystus had often importuned me to let
him have the volumes in question, for which he would
willingly pay me one hundred florins, and think himself
obliged by the bargain; and that I should in all probability
have sold the books at that price, had I not been
prevented by Niccolo Niccoli, who with his accustomed
moroseness declared, that by so doing, I should give an
a indication of a sordid and abject mind. On this our
friend Aurispa said, that you very earnestly wished to
add these epistles to your collection, and desired me to
sell them to you, assuring me that you would cheerfully
pay any price which I should fix upon them. With some
reluctance I complied with his request, and I write to
inform you, that I am willing to part with the books for
the price which has been already offered for them, namely,
one hundred ducats. It remains for you therefore to determine
whether you will purchase them at that price. It
is a matter of indifference to me what your determination
may be; for I do not part with the volumes with a view
of raising money, but merely through a desire of obliging
you. This however I will say, that no person in Italy
possesses in the same compass a larger or a more correct
collection of epistles than those which are contained in
these two volumes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357"></a>[357]</span></p>

<p>“Your friend, the knight of Rieti, when he came to
this town some time ago to gratify his love of ostentation
(for he wished his folly to be known to every body) told
a certain citizen of Ferrara, that you had shewn him the
letter which I wrote concerning him to Guarino. I do not
think that this is the fact; but I wish you would inform
me whether in this matter he adheres to his usual practice
of lying. On his departure hence he told some persons
that he was going to visit his uncle; to others he asserted,
that you had nominated him your ambassador at Florence.
He would think himself undone were he to utter any thing
but falsehood. He must needs be full of truth; for no
truth ever passes through his lips.”<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>

<p>Lionello transmitted to Poggio the hundred ducats, at
which he appreciated his copy of the epistles of Jerome.
He intimated to him, however, that some of the learned
men of Ferrara thought the price an extravagant one; and
he desired that it might be understood, that in acceding to
the terms proposed by his correspondent, he intended to
make him a present of the excess above the real value of
the book. In reply to these observations, Poggio maintained
the correctness of his estimation, in opposition to
the judgment of the Ferrarese connoisseurs, which he treated
with great contempt; and humorously observed, that he
thankfully accepted the gift mentioned by Lionello, not
on account of its intrinsic value, but as an earnest of future
munificence; “for,” said he, “it is the custom of worthy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358"></a>[358]</span>
princes, such as you are, to persevere in what they have
well begun.”<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<p>If the ducat be estimated at ten shillings English
money, the epistles of Jerome were purchased by Lionello
at the expense of fifty pounds sterling.<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> From the history
of Filelfo it appeals, that at this time the salary of a public
professor of literature rarely exceeded four hundred ducats;
so that the price of a couple of volumes absorbed one-fourth
of the sum which was deemed an adequate annual
recompence for the services of a man of consummate learning.
The exhibition of these facts will demonstrate the
difficulties which obstructed the paths of learning in the
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. It will also tend to
make the modern scholar sensible of the tribute of gratitude
which he owes to the inventor of the typographic art.</p>

<p>It was not without considerable reluctance that Eugenius
had yielded to Francesco Sforza the dominion of the
Marca d’Ancona; and he had long waited with impatience
for the occurrence of some favourable opportunity to wrest
from that chieftain the territory which he had so unwillingly
conceded to him. In the year 1442, he flattered himself
that he should be enabled to accomplish this object of his
earnest desire. Regnier of Anjou being then closely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a>[359]</span>
besieged in the city of Naples by Alfonso of Arragon,
had solicited the assistance of Sforza, who dispatched a
body of troops to make a diversion in his favour. Eugenius
taking advantage of this conjuncture, formally deprived
Sforza of the office of Gonfaloniere of the holy see, which
he bestowed on his rival Piccinino. In obedience to the
orders of his new sovereign, Piccinino immediately invaded
the Marca, and made himself master of the city of Todi.
This incursion compelled Sforza to withdraw from Naples
the forces which he had destined to the relief of Regnier,
who after the loss of his capital was compelled to quit Italy,
and to retire into Provence.<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> Eugenius seeing Alfonso
thus firmly established on the Neapolitan throne, not only
agreed to terms of pacification with him, but endeavoured
to procure his assistance in depriving their common enemy
of the dominion of the Marca. The Florentines, who had
constantly entertained very friendly dispositions towards
Sforza, openly interposed to counteract the measures which
Eugenius had adopted to expel their favourite general from
the territories of the church. This political difference gave
rise to a coolness between Eugenius and the administrators
of the Tuscan government, in consequence of which the
pontiff determined to quit the city of Florence, and to
repair to Rome. He accordingly set out on his journey on
the seventh of March, 1443, and on the ensuing day he
arrived at Siena, in which city he continued to reside till
the month of September.<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"></a>[360]</span></p>

<p>Soon after the pontiff’s arrival in Siena, his court was
deprived of an illustrious member, by the death of Nicolao
Albergato, cardinal of Santa Croce.<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> In this event Poggio
was deeply interested, as that eminent ecclesiastic, who was
distinguished by his liberal patronage of learned men, had
long honoured him with his affectionate esteem. In grateful
respect for the memory of his deceased friend, Poggio
undertook to record his virtues in a funeral eulogium.
From this document it appears, that Nicolao Albergato
was a native of Bologna, the descendant of an honourable
family. At an early age he dedicated himself to the
study of the civil law, in which he made a considerable
proficiency. But when he had attained to years of
maturity, his religious zeal induced him to bid farewell
to the cares of the world, and to enter into the monastic
fraternity of the Carthusians. So exemplary was his
observance of the severe rules of this strict order, that,
soon after his admission into it, he was appointed to the
office of superior. The fame of his austerity, his prudence
and discretion, having reached his native place, on the
occurrence of a vacancy in the episcopal throne of Bologna,
his fellow citizens unanimously invited him to preside over
their spiritual affairs. It was not without considerable
reluctance that he undertook this arduous office, by the
discharge of the duties of which he, however, confirmed
and increased his reputation. Exerting his utmost endeavours
to restrain the licentiousness of the clergy, he studiously
set his brethren an example of the most decorous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361"></a>[361]</span>
correctness of manners, and of the utmost purity of moral
conduct. His charity was diffusive, but discriminating.
He assiduously sought for the children of distress, who
were induced by the ingenuous emotions of shame to hide
their poverty in uncomplaining retirement, and he secretly
relieved their wants. His patriarchal virtues attracted the
notice of Martin V., who without any solicitation on his
part raised him to the dignity of cardinal. After his
advancement to this high honour, he was employed by that
pontiff and by his successor Eugenius IV. in various negotiations
of the greatest importance, in the conduct of
which he evinced a degree of skill in the transaction of
business, which would have done honour to one who had
been from his early youth versed in the active concerns of
life. His latter years were years of pain, occasioned by
the pangs of an excruciating disease, which he bore with
the most exemplary patience, and from which he was
relieved by the welcome hand of death, in the sixty-eighth
year of his age.<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></p>

<p>Had the cardinal of Santa Croce been rendered illustrious
by no other circumstance, his patronage of Tommaso
da Sarzana, who under the appellation of Nicolas V. became
one of the brightest ornaments of the pontificate, would
have been in itself sufficient to secure to him the praises of
posterity. Tommaso was the son of Bartolomeo dei Parentucelli,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>[362]</span>
a professor of arts and of medicine in the city of
Pisa. His mother Andreola was a native of Sarzana. He
had scarcely attained to the age of seven years, when he
experienced an irreparable misfortune in the death of his
father. In consequence of this event Andreola removed
from Pisa to Sarzana, where she soon consoled herself for
the loss of Bartolomeo, in the arms of a second husband.
This new connexion was rendered unhappy by the illiberality
of her spouse, who looked upon his step-son with a jealous
eye, and embittered the days of the unoffending youth, by the
harshness of his behaviour towards him. This unfortunate
circumstance rendered Andreola very anxious concerning
the future destination of her son, which, however, she
flattered herself was at length fixed by supernatural interposition.—When
Tommaso was about ten years of age he
was seized by the plague, by which dreadful malady he was
soon reduced to the last extremity. Exhausted with fatigue,
occasioned by her unremitting attendance upon her favourite
child, Andreola sunk into a disturbed slumber, during the
continuance of which an angel seemed to appear before her,
and to promise that the object of her care should recover
from his disease, if she would promise to dedicate to the
priesthood the life which, for this high purpose alone, the
mercy of God would vouchsafe to spare. Waking from her
dream, Andreola made a solemn vow that she would fulfil
the direction of the heavenly messenger—and her child
recovered. In pursuance of her sacred engagement, when
Tommaso had attained the age of twelve years, she sent
him to commence his studies at Bologna. The rigid moroseness
of her husband, however, would not permit her to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363"></a>[363]</span>
furnish the youthful student with any means of supporting
himself. At this feeble age, therefore, the future pontiff
was banished from an uncomfortable home, and sent forth
into the wide world, with no resources but his genius, his
virtues, and the generosity of the benevolent. These apparently
inauspicious circumstances called into exertion an
energy of mind which cannot be too highly applauded.
For the space of six years Tommaso applied himself to his
studies with astonishing diligence, and soon made considerable
progress in various departments of knowledge. When
he had attained his eighteenth year, his literary reputation
induced two eminent citizens of Florence to invite him to
undertake the education of their children. This invitation
Tommaso readily accepted; and from his eighteenth to his
twenty-second year, he was engaged in the laborious employment
of initiating his pupils in the rudiments of learning.
Having at the end of four years from the time of his arrival
in Florence, by strict economy, accumulated a sum of
money, which he deemed sufficient to enable him to prosecute
his studies with advantage, he returned to Bologna.
His literary accomplishments had now gained him the
countenance of several respectable friends, at whose recommendation
he was admitted into the family of Nicolao
Albergato, who was then the bishop of that city. By his
prudence and good conduct he gained the esteem of his
patron, who soon promoted him to the stewardship of his
household. In the midst of the multifarious employments
which devolved upon him in consequence of his acceptance
of this office, Tommaso found leisure to fathom the depths
of scholastic theology. When he had attained the age of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364"></a>[364]</span>
five-and-twenty, in discharge of his mother’s vow, he enrolled
himself in the priesthood. He continued to live in
the family of Nicolao Albergato for the space of twenty
years, at the end of which period the death of that prelate
obliged him to seek a new patron. His well-known virtues
soon obtained for him the countenance and support of
Gerardo d’Andriani, cardinal of Santa Maria Transtevere.
In the suite of this dignitary he accompanied Eugenius to
Rome, to which city the papal court was transferred on the
twenty-eight of September, 1443. He had not long resided
in the pontifical capital before he was distinguished by the
favour of Eugenius, who on the death of his second protector
took him into his service, and appointed him sub-deacon
of the apostolic see, and soon afterwards promoted
him to the honourable office of vice-chamberlain.<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></p>

<p>During his attendance upon the pontiff at Bologna Poggio
enjoyed frequent opportunities of becoming thoroughly
acquainted with the singular merits of Tommaso, whose
proficiency in literature and ingenuous manners had some
years before engaged his esteem, and conciliated his affection.
Nor was Tommaso insensible of the good qualities
of Poggio. A memorial of the mutual regard which subsisted
between these able scholars, exists in the dedication
of a Dialogue <i>On the Unhappiness of Princes</i>, which Poggio
published in the year 1440, and which he inscribed to
his friend before his virtues had been brought forward to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>[365]</span>
public observation by his acquisition of distinguished honour
and great emolument. In this dedication Poggio notices
the common error of men, who are so much struck with the
pomp and grandeur of the great, that they take it for
granted, that power and magnificence confer on their possessors
the gift of true felicity. He observes, however, that
those who rise above the level of vulgar intellect ought to be
convinced that happiness does not depend upon the external
blessings of fortune, but that it is the meed of virtuous dispositions.
He professes that it is his object to persuade
men of this truth; and remarks that a work which is
intended to promote this happy end, may with the strictest
propriety be addressed to an ecclesiastic, who in the whole
course of his conduct has demonstrated, that he has studied
to be virtuous, rather than to be rich or great.<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p>

<p>After this preface, Poggio proceeds to state, that in
the summer of the year in which he followed Eugenius IV.
to Florence, to which city the pontiff was banished by the
fury of the Roman populace, he happened to pay a visit
to Niccolo Niccoli, whose house was the common resort
of the learned. Here he found Carlo Aretino and Cosmo
de’ Medici, with whom he entered into conversation on
the politics of Italy. After having recounted to his friends
the hardships which he had lately suffered when he was
taken captive by the soldiers of Piccinino, he complained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366"></a>[366]</span>
of the unsettled life which he led in consequence of his
attendance upon the Roman court, which in the course of
thirty-four years that had elapsed since his admission into
the pontifical chancery, had never continued for two years
together in the same place. On this Carlo Aretino remarked,
that Poggio was discontented with a situation
which the generality of men regard as an object of envy,
since the pontiffs and their superior servants are usually deemed
masters of every circumstance necessary to the insurance
of a happy life. In consequence of this observation,
Niccolo Niccoli gave it as his opinion, that whatever
advantages the attendants and courtiers of great potentates
may derive from the control which they acquire over public
affairs, princes themselves lead a life of anxiety and care,
and endure all the inconveniences, whilst others reap all
the benefits of empire. Such is the introduction to the
Dialogue <i>On the Unhappiness of Princes</i>, in the body of
which Niccolo Niccoli is represented as detailing the miseries
of exalted rank. On this copious subject he dilates at
considerable length, proving from history that the best
princes are liable to the bitterest woes incident to human
nature. Gaining courage as he proceeds, he attempts to
demonstrate that eminence of station is unfriendly to virtue.
Examining the conduct of the most renowned chieftains,
both monarchs and demagogues, who have rendered themselves
conspicuous in the annals of the world, he impeaches
them of avarice, cruelty, intemperance, pride, and unbridled
ambition; and appeals to his auditors, whether men who
are thus enslaved by their passions, can possibly be deemed
happy. Arguing upon the position, that man is the creature<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>[367]</span>
of the circumstances in which he is placed, he maintains,
that the possession of uncontrolled authority betrays the
powerful into vice, inasmuch as it frees them from those
salutary restraints which are necessary to the confirmation of
good principles. Hence, he observes, it frequently happens,
that men who have adorned a private station by
their virtues have become the disgrace of human nature
when they have been raised to the summit of power.</p>

<p>From this train of argument Niccolo draws the conclusion,
that as happiness seems to be banished from the
palaces of the great, if she resides any where on earth,
she must be found in the abodes of private individuals,
who have the wisdom to set bounds to their desires, and to
dedicate themselves to the cultivation of their intellectual
powers. The conduct of these men he proposes as an
object of imitation, and exhorts his friends to the study
of those principles of philosophy which will render them
happy in themselves, and fearless of the power, and independent
of the favours of the great.<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<p>Such is the tenor of the Dialogue <i>On the Unhappiness
of Princes</i>, in which Poggio dwells with so much energy
on the vices of exalted rank, that it may reasonably be
suspected that resentment and indignation had at least as
much influence in its composition as the suggestions of
philosophy. In perusing this work, the reader is perpetually
led to recollect, that its author was a citizen of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368"></a>[368]</span>
proud republic, and a zealot in the cause of learning. His
democratic asperity bursts forth in copious enumerations of
the follies and vices of sovereign princes. His literary
spleen is discernible in the sarcastic observations which he
introduces by the medium of Niccolo Niccoli, on the
indifference with which the rulers of Italy regarded his
researches after the lost works of the writers of antiquity;
in the detail which he gives of the neglect and scorn
which Dante, Petrarca, and Bocaccio experienced from the
great men of their times; and in the general observations
which he makes upon the contempt with which mighty
potentates too frequently regard the labours of the learned.
The effusions of moroseness which occur in this dialogue
are, however, interspersed with precepts of sound morality,
and the historic details with which it abounds are at once
entertaining and instructive. To which it may be added,
that Poggio has exhibited in this composition a striking,
and in all probability a correct delineation of the temper
and manners of the splenetic, but sagacious disputant
Niccolo Niccoli.<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>

<p>This dialogue was not well calculated to conciliate
the favour of sovereign princes. But the patronage of
the great was not the object of its author’s wishes. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369"></a>[369]</span>
was sufficient for Poggio that it was received with approbation
by the learned, and that it secured to him the
esteem of Tommaso da Sarzana, and other private individuals,
whose kind regard might compensate the depredations
made amongst his comforts by the ravages of death.
For he was now arrived at that period of life in which
man is generally called to experience the severest of trials,
in being doomed to survive his friends. He had already
lamented the death of Niccolo Niccoli. He had attended,
a mournful assistant at the funeral of Lorenzo de’ Medici.
Leonardo Aretino was the only associate of his early studies,
who was left to sympathize with him in the recollection of
their juvenile pleasures. In the strength of Leonardo’s
constitution, Poggio fondly hoped that he had an assurance,
that the happiness which he derived from his friendly
attachment would be prolonged to the close of his own
mortal career. But in the commencement of the year 1444,
a violent disease suddenly bereft him of the sole surviving
companion of his youthful years. In Leonardo he lost
not only a kind, but also a powerful friend. Soon after that
accomplished scholar had fixed his residence in Florence, he
was called by the favour of the people to fill some of the
most important offices of the state. By his faithful discharge
of the duties of these offices he acquired such a
high degree of popularity, that he was at length promoted
to the chief magistracy of the Florentine republic.</p>

<p>So great was the estimation in which he was held by
his fellow-citizens, that when his death was announced, the
administrators of the government charged three members<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370"></a>[370]</span>
of the council of ten to conduct his funeral rites with the
most solemn magnificence at the public expense.<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> In order
to express in the most signal manner their respect for the
memory of the deceased, they also determined publicly to
decorate his remains with a laurel crown. The rare occurrence
of this testimony of honour (of the conferring of which
only three instances had hitherto occurred in the long series
of the Florentine annals)<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> rendered it the more illustrious.
In pursuance of the orders of the magistrates, the body of
Leonardo arrayed in silken robes was carried in an open
coffin to the public square of the city. On his breast was laid,
as a memorial of his patriotism, his history of the Florentine
Republic. The funeral procession was attended by all the
officers of state, except the Gonfaloniere, by the embassadors
of foreign princes who happened at this time to reside
in Florence, by a considerable number of learned men, and
by an immense concourse of the citizens, who were not
more attracted by the novelty of the ceremony, than by
their respectful remembrance of the virtues of Leonardo.
In the presence of this august assembly Gianozzo Manetti
advanced to the head of the bier, and there pronounced a
funeral oration in praise of the deceased, towards the conclusion
of which he fulfilled the decree of the magistracy,
by crowning him with the laurel wreath. The friends of
Leonardo whose judgment was enlightened by the principles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371"></a>[371]</span>
of true taste, must have lamented that the task of celebrating
his virtues was delegated to Gianozzo Manetti. The
speech which he pronounced on this occasion is a most
miserable composition, abounding in puerilities, vulgar in
its style, irrelevant in its topics, and most tediously diffuse.<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>
It is highly probable, that the vexation experienced by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372"></a>[372]</span>
Poggio, on seeing the memory of his beloved friend thus
disgraced by the folly of his panegyrist, induced him to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373"></a>[373]</span>
endeavour to supersede the wretched effusion of Gianozzo by
a composition more worthy of the lamented subject of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374"></a>[374]</span>
public grief. However this may be, certain it is, that the
funeral oration which he published on this melancholy occasion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375"></a>[375]</span>
affords a striking contrast to that which wearied the ears
of the learned men who attended the obsequies of Leonardo.
It is at once dignified and pathetic. Lucid in its
arrangement, and well proportioned in the distribution of
its parts, it is a monument of the sound judgment of its
author. The account which it contains of the life and
writings of Leonardo is succinct and clear. In his delineation
of the moral portraiture of that extraordinary man,
Poggio evinces a distinctness of perception, and an accuracy
of discrimination, which are highly honourable to his
understanding; whilst the delicacy with which he softens
down the faulty features of Leonardo’s character, attests
the warmth of his affection for the beloved depository of
his most secret thoughts.<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>

<p>Leonardo Aretino was perhaps the ablest scholar of
his age. He took the lead amongst the industrious students
who unlocked the secret treasures of literature by the translation
of the works of the Grecian authors. His Latin
style is less encumbered with faults than that of any of his
contemporaries. Æneas Sylvius indeed declared it as his
opinion, that next to Lactantius he approached the nearest
of any of the later writers to the elegance of Cicero. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376"></a>[376]</span>
compositions of that celebrated orator do not, however,
seem to have been adopted by Leonardo as his model. At
least he did not in his writings attain the copious fluency,
or the graceful ease of diction which distinguish the works
of Cicero. But the luminous distinctness of his periods
entitles him to no small commendation. His sentences are
never embarrassed or confused. He conveys his meaning
in few words, and does not fatigue his readers by unreasonably
dwelling upon his topics, or by repeating the same
idea in varied forms of expression. Hence, if his language
is not polished to an exquisite smoothness, it is sufficiently
precise, and its deficiency in melody is compensated by its
strength.</p>

<p>At his outset in life, Leonardo had to struggle with the
embarrassments incident to a very contracted fortune, and
was compelled by necessity to practise the strictest economy.
By the liberality of John XXII. however, he acquired an
increase of property which eventually became the foundation
of a very ample fortune. As man is the slave of habit, he
retained, in the midst of abundance, the attention to the
minutiæ of expence which was a duty imperiously incumbent
upon him in the days of his poverty; and his prudent
exactitude sometimes approached the confines of avarice.<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a>
He was also impatient in his temper, and too apt to take
offence.<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> The following anecdote however shews, that if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377"></a>[377]</span>
he was easily excited to anger, he had the good sense to be
soon convinced of his error, and the ingenuousness of spirit
to confess it. Having engaged in a literary discussion with
Gianozzo Manetti, he was so exasperated by observing that
the bye-standers thought him worsted in argument, that
he vented his spleen in outrageous expressions against his
antagonist. On the following morning, however, by break
of day, he went to the house of Gianozzo, who expressed
his surprise, that a person of Leonardo’s dignity should
condescend to honour him so far as to pay him an unsolicited
visit. On this Leonardo requested that Gianozzo would
favour him with a private conference. Gianozzo accordingly
attended him to the banks of the Arno, when Leonardo
thus apologized for the warmth of his temper.—“Yesterday
I did you great injustice; but I soon began to suffer
punishment for my offence; for I have not closed my
eyes during the whole night; and I could not rest till I
had made you a confession of my fault.”<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> The man who
by the voluntary acknowledgment of an error could thus
frankly throw himself upon the generosity of one whom he
had offended, must have possessed in his own mind a fund
of honour and probity. The failings of Leonardo were
indeed amply counterbalanced by his strict integrity, his
guarded temperance, his faithful discharge of his public
duties, and his zeal in the cause of literature. This being
the case, it was with justice that Poggio prided himself
upon the intimate friendship which subsisted between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378"></a>[378]</span>
himself and this truly respectable character—a friendship
which was not once interrupted during the varied transactions
of a period of forty-four years.</p>

<p>The remains of Leonardo were interred in the church
of Santa Croce. On a marble monument erected to his
memory the following inscription is still legible.</p>

<p class="center">POSTQVAM LEONARDVS E VITA MIGRAVIT<br>
HISTORIA LVGET ELOQUENTIA MVTA EST<br>
FERTVRQVE MVSAS TVM GRAECAS TVM LATINAS<br>
LACRIMAS TENERE NON POTVISSE.</p>

<p>Leonardo was succeeded in the chancellorship of the
Florentine republic by Carlo Marsuppini, more commonly
known by the surname of Aretino, a scholar no less distinguished
by his literary acquirements than by the dignity
of his family. Carlo was the son of Gregorio Marsuppini,
a nobleman of Arezzo, doctor of laws, and secretary to
Charles VI., king of France, by whom he was appointed
to the government of Genoa. Educated under the auspices
of John of Ravenna, he attained to such a proficiency in
learning, that in delivering lectures on rhetoric he became
the successful rival of Filelfo in the university of Florence.
His literary reputation recommended him to the notice of
Eugenius IV., who, in the year 1441, conferred upon him
the office of apostolic secretary. This office he continued
to hold till the voice of his fellow-citizens summoned him
to the discharge of more important duties.<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> The friendly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379"></a>[379]</span>
intercourse which had taken place between him and Poggio,
in consequence of their being natives of the same place,
had been strengthened by their common hostility against
Francesco Filelfo. Nor was it interrupted by their separation.
Whenever Poggio found leisure to visit the Tuscan
capital, he experienced a welcome reception from his ancient
associate, in whose instructive converse he found the most
pleasing relaxation from the toils of his office, and from
the wearisomeness occasionally attendant upon the diligent
prosecution of literary studies.<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

<p>Whilst Poggio was lamenting the irreparable loss
which he had sustained by the death of Leonardo Aretino,
he received intelligence of the sad catastrophe of his old
friend and correspondent, Julian, cardinal of St. Angelo.
This zealous churchman, who had been dispatched into
Hungary, vested with the office of pontifical legate, had
heard with indignation that Ladislaus VI., king of that
country, had concluded a truce for ten years with Amurath,
emperor of the Turks; and strenuously insisting upon the
detestable doctrine, that no faith is to be kept with infidels,
he had persuaded the Hungarian monarch treacherously to
attack the Mussulmans, who, in reliance on the treaty
which had been so lately concluded, had withdrawn their
forces into Asia. Justly irritated by this act of perfidy,
the Turks rushed to arms, and gave battle to the Hungarians
at Varna, a town in Bulgaria. The issue of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380"></a>[380]</span>
day was most disastrous to the Christians. Ladislaus fell
in the battle, his forces were routed, and a body of the
fugitives, in the course of their flight, overtaking the
unfortunate Julian, whose pernicious counsels they considered
as the original cause of their present calamities,
fell upon him, and despatched him with a multitude of
wounds.<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></p>

<p>The prejudices which Poggio entertained against the
professors of Mohamedism, or the partiality of his friendship
for the cardinal, rendered him insensible of the atrocity
of the crime by which that turbulent ecclesiastic had provoked
his fate. From the fragments of an oration which
he composed on the occasion of the funeral of Julian, and
which are preserved by Mehus in his life of Ambrogio
Traversari,<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> he seems to have considered his character as
a subject of unqualified praise. The birth of Julian was
obscure. He prosecuted his studies, first at Perugia, afterwards
at Bologna, and lastly at Padua. When his education
was finished, he entered into the household of the
cardinal of Piacenza, in whose suite he travelled into Bohemia,
where he signalized himself by his acuteness in theological
disputation, and by the assiduity of his labours for the
conversion of heretics. On his return to Italy, Martin V.
rewarded his zeal in the defence of the orthodox faith, by
appointing him to the office of auditor of the chamber.
He was afterwards sent in quality of nuncio into France<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381"></a>[381]</span>
and England. Making mention of his residence in the
latter country, Poggio asserts that he did there what no one
had ever ventured to do before him: in a numerous assembly
of prelates, he uttered a vehement invective against the
statutes which had been enacted in the parliament, with a
view of restraining the authority of the court of Rome, and
admonished his auditors to yield obedience to the pope,
rather than to the laws of their country: “a proceeding,”
says Poggio, “attended with great peril in a land the
inhabitants of which were not accustomed to such boldness.”
This temerity procured Julian the gift of a
cardinal’s hat, which was bestowed upon him by Martin V.,
immediately on his return from England.<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> His second
mission into Bohemia, his pertinacity in summoning and
presiding over the council of Basil, and his conversion to
the interests of Eugenius, have already passed in review in
the course of the present work.</p>

<p>The steady forbearance of Julian in refusing to enrich
himself by the acceptance of presents, which Poggio records
with enthusiastic applause, is a legitimate subject of commendation—but
his zeal in the course of proselytism is an
indication of a narrow mind; and the treachery which signalized
the last official act of his life fixes on his memory an
indelible stain. So base indeed was his conduct on this
occasion, that his miserable end may be pointed out as an
instance of the signal vengeance which awaits the perfidious
violators of solemn treaties.</p>

<p>It has been already observed, that in the year 1443
Eugenius earnestly solicited the king of Naples to assist
him in expelling Francesco Sforza from the ecclesiastical
territories, the possession of which constituted such a
formidable accession to his power. In compliance with the
wishes of the pontiff, Alfonso advanced at the head of a
considerable army into the Marca d’Ancona, almost the
whole of which district he in a short space of time restored
to the dominion of the church.<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> [A. D. 1444.] In the
course of the ensuing spring, however, Sforza invaded the
disputed territory with such vigour and military skill, that
he once more compelled the pontiff to confer upon him
the feudal sovereignty of all its cities, except Osimo,
Recanati, Fabriano, and Ancona.<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> But in the year 1445,
Eugenius, having secured the assistance of the duke of
Milan and of the king of Naples, again violated his
solemn engagements, and declared war against his vassal.
The perfidy of the pontiff was at length crowned with success;
for by the joint efforts of the allied powers, Sforza
was dispossessed of the whole extent of the Marca, except<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386"></a>[386]</span>
the city of Jesi.<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> Thus had Eugenius the satisfaction of
reducing all the territories belonging to the church; Jesi
and Bologna being the only cities of the ecclesiastical states
which refused to acknowledge his authority. He did not
long enjoy the fruit of his anxious deliberations and strenuous
exertions. In the commencement of the year 1447
he was seized by a distemper which soon assumed a most
serious aspect. In this extremity he continued to manifest
that undaunted resolution which was a distinguishing feature
of his character, and struggled against his last enemy with
all the vigour of an unyielding spirit. His attendants
witnessed his fortitude with the highest admiration, and
for a time flattered themselves that the strength of his constitution
would baffle the power of his disease. When his
friends had at length lost all hope of his recovery, the archbishop
of Florence gave him intimation of their opinion
by preparing to administer to him the rites which are
appointed by the Catholic church for the comfort of the
dying. But the pontiff indignantly commanded him to
forbear his officious interposition. “I am not yet,” said
he, “reduced to the last extremity—I will apprize you
when my time is come.” This promise he fulfilled, and in
a manner which evinced the intrepidity and even cheerfulness
with which he foresaw his approaching dissolution.
“My friends,” said he to the attendant ecclesiastics, during
a pause which occurred in the reading of morning
prayers, “when the holy office is finished I will tell you a
story.” The devotional exercise being ended, he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387"></a>[387]</span>
reminded of his promise, on which he thus addressed his
assembled household.—“A certain Athenian once came
forth into the street, and in the midst of a large concourse
of people made the following proclamation.—If
any one wishes to hang himself on my fig-tree, let him
make haste, for I am going to cut it down. In like
manner,” said the pontiff, “if my friends wish to solicit
from me any favours, they must not delay, for I am sensible
that the hour of my departure draws near.” The
priest in waiting having informed him that they were going
to offer solemn prayers for his recovery—“Pray rather,”
said he, “that the Lord’s will may be done; for we often
petition for that which is not conducive to our good.”
When he was conscious of the near approach of death, he
piously participated in the customary ceremonies, and then
caused himself to be raised from his bed and conveyed to
the chair of St. Peter, where he breathed his last on the
twenty-third day of February, 1447.<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<p>The funeral eulogium of the deceased pontiff was
pronounced by Tommaso da Sarzana, who had lately been
promoted by his favour to the bishopric of Bologna, and
to the dignity of cardinal. The acquisition of this honour
prepared the way for the exaltation of Tommaso to the
summit of ecclesiastical preferment. On the sixth of March<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388"></a>[388]</span>
he was by the unanimous voice of the conclave invested with
the pontifical purple, on which occasion he assumed the name
of Nicolas V. His biographer, Gianozzo Manetti, asserts,
that his advancement to this high dignity was prognosticated
to him in the following manner. When the conclave was
assembled for the purpose of filling the vacancy which had
just occurred in the chair of St. Peter, and Tommaso was
sleeping at dead of night in the small chamber allotted to
him on that occasion, he dreamt that Eugenius appeared
before him arrayed in his pontifical robes, of which he
divested himself, and commanded him to put them on;
and that on his refusal to comply with this requisition,
the deceased pontiff violently enforced his obedience, and
invested him with all the insignia of papal authority.
Gianozzo seems to intimate, that in this dream there was
something præternatural. But a slight acquaintance with
the constitution of the human mind would have convinced
him, that there is nothing miraculous in the circumstance
of a cardinal’s dreaming that his brows are encircled with
the tiara.<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></p>

<p>On his elevation to the chair of St. Peter, Nicolas
found the temporalities of the holy see in a lamentable
state of disorder. The military enterprizes of Eugenius<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389"></a>[389]</span>
had exhausted the pontifical treasury; the anarchy to which
the long absence of that pontiff from his capital had given
rise in the ecclesiastical territories, had impeded the collection
of the public revenues; and the schism occasioned by
the intemperance of the council of Basil had impaired the
spiritual authority of the church.<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> Whilst the unpropitious
circumstances which thus attended the commencement
of his pontificate affected the mind of Nicolas with well-founded
anxiety, his uneasiness was encreased by the contemplation
of the distracted state of Italy. The Venetians
and the duke of Milan were engaged in an obstinate and
bloody contest, which spread devastation through the fertile
provinces of Lombardy. Alfonso, king of Naples, having
been instigated by Eugenius to declare war against the
Florentines, had marched on his way to the Tuscan frontier
as far as Tivoli, where his army lay encamped at the time
of that pontiff’s death.<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> Justly apprehensive lest the
collision of interests which occurs in a period of general
warfare should disturb the peace of the pontifical dominions,
Nicolas found himself surrounded by difficulties which
called into full exercise the extraordinary abilities which
he had cultivated with such successful industry. His first
object was to remedy the confusion which prevailed in the
ecclesiastical states. This object he speedily accomplished
by a prudent choice of magistrates, by the establishment
of a well-regulated system of internal economy, and by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390"></a>[390]</span>
the mildness of a lenient administration of government.
At the price of thirty-five thousand florins of gold he
purchased from Francesco Sforza the possession of the city
of Jesi.<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> The inhabitants of Bologna, influenced by the
remembrance of the benevolence which shone conspicuous
in his character, whilst he exercised amongst them the
episcopal functions, sacrificed their independence to their
gratitude, and voluntarily submitted to his authority.<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>
The endeavours of Nicolas to inspire the other potentates
of Italy with the ardent desire of peace which influenced
his own actions were not crowned with equally prompt
success. Alfonso proceeded on his march to the Florentine
state, which he continued to harrass for the space of three
years, at the end of which period he agreed to terms of
pacification. The death of Filippo Maria, duke of Milan,
which event took place on the thirteenth of August, 1447,<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>
exposed his dominions to all the miseries of civil discord.
Whilst the king of Naples asserted his title to the ducal
crown by virtue of a pretended will, said to have been
executed by Filippo during his last illness, Charles, duke
of Orleans, maintained his own claim to the inheritance of
the sovereignty of the Milanese, in right of his wife, Valentina
Visconti, daughter of the late duke, who had died
without male issue. As the son-in-law of Filippo, Francesco
Sforza also deemed himself justified in aspiring to the
throne of Milan.<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> In the mean time the inhabitants of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391"></a>[391]</span>
that city, rejecting the pretensions of all the competitors,
declared for independence, and instituted a republican
form of government. The infant commonwealth was, however,
doomed to struggle with unconquerable difficulties.
Whilst it was harrassed by the Venetians, its strength was
enfeebled by the anarchy of faction. After suffering a
variety of calamities in the course of a protracted siege,
the inhabitants of Milan were, in the year 1450, compelled
by famine to open their gates to Sforza, who on the twenty-fifth
of March, solemnly assumed the ducal diadem.<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>

<p>In the midst of these hostile operations, Nicolas had
the prudence and the skill to observe a strict neutrality, and
thus to secure to the ecclesiastical territories the blessings of
public tranquillity. In the contemplation of the growing
prosperity of his subjects the pontiff found an ample reward
for his anxious endeavours to promote their welfare. The
flourishing state of his finances, the consequence of his cultivation
of the arts of peace, was also a source of considerable
satisfaction to him, as it furnished him with the
means of gratifying his passion for the encouragement of
learning. Fostered by his patronage, the scholars of Italy
no longer had reason to complain that they were doomed to
obscurity and contempt. Nicolas invited to his court all
those who were distinguished by their proficiency in ancient
literature; and whilst he afforded them full scope for the
exertion of their talents, he requited their labours by liberal
remunerations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392"></a>[392]</span></p>

<p>Poggio did not neglect to take advantage of the rising
tide of fortune. Eugenius IV. was the seventh pontiff in
whose service he had continued to hold the office of apostolic
secretary, without being promoted to any of the superior
departments of the Roman chancery. His objections to the
ecclesiastical life had indeed shut against him one of the
avenues to preferment; and the negligence of his patrons,
or the confused state of the temporalities attached to the
holy see, had hitherto prevented him from receiving any
recompense for his labours at all adequate to his own estimate
of their value.<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> But when Nicolas V. had ascended
the pontifical throne, his prospects were brightened by the
hope of spending the remainder of his days in the comforts
of independence, if not in affluence. In order that he
might not be wanting to the prosecution of his own interests,
he resolved to testify his respectful attachment to
the newly-created pontiff, by addressing to him a congratulatory
oration. On this occasion, however, he could not
but recollect that not many years had elapsed since he had
dedicated to his friend his dialogue <i>De Infelicitate Principum</i>;
and he was sensible that it was absolutely necessary
to preserve in his address to Nicolas V. some degree of
consistency with the principles which he had formerly endeavoured
to sanction by the patronage of Tommaso da Sarzana.
In the exordium of this oration, therefore, he professed
that he could not conscientiously congratulate the
pontiff on his being summoned to undergo immense labour
of body, and to exert continual activity of mind. “For,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393"></a>[393]</span>
said he, “if you are determined to guide the vessel of St.
Peter properly, and according to the precepts of God,
you will not be able to indulge yourself in the least relaxation,
or to give yourself up, as you have been accustomed
to do, to the joys of friendship and of literature.
You must live according to the pleasure of others, and
you must give up your own ease, in order to promote the
welfare of the Christian community. You are placed as
a sentinel to watch for the safety of all, and you are
doomed from henceforth never to know the blessings of
repose.” After enlarging on these topics, Poggio declared
that he would not run the risk of incurring the imputation
of flattery, by detailing the virtues which adorned the character
of his holiness. “What then,” continued he, “can I
say? In treating on this subject, upon what circumstances
can I enlarge?—I answer, that they who are raised to
the pontifical dignity may be properly addressed in terms
of admonition and exhortation.” Proceeding in pursuance
of this principle to enumerate the good qualities which
ought to confer lustre on the pontifical throne, he reminded
the father of the faithful, that it was incumbent upon him
to be just, merciful, beneficent, courteous, and humble.
He warned him to beware of sycophants and deceitful
detractors, who frequently betray the best of princes into
dangerous errors; and finally, he exhorted him never to
sell for money those honours and sources of emolument
which ought to be appropriated as the meed of virtue.
Having enlarged as much as prudence would permit upon
the head of admonition, Poggio thus skilfully introduced
an eulogium on the virtues of his patron. “But in this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394"></a>[394]</span>
address, most holy father! I labour under peculiar
difficulties; for my knowledge of your singular and
transcendent virtues deprives me of the most copious
subjects of discourse. For what room is there for the
administration of exhortation or admonition to you, who
are entitled by your wisdom to admonish others?” After
a long detail of the good qualities of the pontiff, the orator
thus proceeded.—“I may justly, and without imputation
of flattery, call upon you to imitate yourself—to remember
by what arts and by what practices you have reached
this high dignity, and to persevere in that line of conduct
which has led you to the attainment of such illustrious
honours. Let me also entreat you, most holy father,
not to forget your ancient friends, of which number I
profess myself to be one. You well know that friendship
originates in a similarity of studies, and in the joint
cultivation of virtuous principles. Though the attainment
of high authority by one of the parties is wont to
separate those who have been united by the bonds of
mutual affection, yet he ought more especially to retain
his kind regard for his former associates, who does not
seek for friends amongst those who can promote his
interests, but amongst the virtuous. Forget not then
to minister to the necessities of your ancient companions.
Become the protector of men of genius, and cause the
liberal arts to raise their drooping heads. You see that
literature is neglected, whilst men apply themselves to
those studies which convert strife into a source of gain.
Small is the number of those who are inspired with the
love of science, and in an age in which ambition and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395"></a>[395]</span>
wealth are more highly esteemed than virtue and probity,
they are regarded as inglorious and ignoble. From you
alone, most holy father, we expect a remedy for these
evils—for you alone is reserved the honour of restoring
the dignity of literature, and of providing for the welfare
of the learned.” After a brief enumeration of the
advantages which would accrue to the pontiff from his
encouragement of men of letters, Poggio adverted to his
own situation and circumstances in the following terms.
“I am now a veteran soldier of the Roman court, in which
I have resided for the space of forty years, and certainly
with less emolument than might have been justly expected
by one who is not entirely destitute of virtue and
of learning. It is now time for me to be discharged
from the service, and to dedicate the remainder of my
old age to bodily rest and to mental employment. But
if, most holy father, I do not obtain the means of an
honourable retirement from your benevolence, I know
not to whose favour and assistance I can lay a claim.”<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>

<p>So far was Nicolas V. from being offended by the
freedom with which Poggio in this oration reminded him
of his duty, that he testified his esteem for his monitor by
conferring upon him very liberal presents. So noble indeed
was the munificence of the pontiff, that Poggio declared,
that in consequence of the generosity of this enlightened
Mæcenas, he regarded himself as at length reconciled to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396"></a>[396]</span>
fortune.<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> The genial warmth of the sunshine of prosperity
did not, however, cause Poggio to relax in his
mental exertions. On the contrary, the prospect of honour
and profit, and the spirit of emulation excited by the
success of his learned competitors, stimulated him, notwithstanding
the advanced period of life to which he had
now attained, to pursue his studies with renewed assiduity.
He had for a long space of time been occasionally
employed in collecting materials for a Dialogue <i>On the
Vicissitudes of Fortune</i>. These materials he now began
to arrange, and having finished and carefully corrected
his work, he submitted it to the public inspection, [A. D.
1447.] under the patronage of the pontiff, to whom he
respectfully inscribed it by a dedicatory epistle. In this
address he descanted on the utility of history, and pointed
out the moral tendency of his Dialogue, which, by demonstrating
the instability of human things, would repress the
confidence of pride and the aspiring views of ambition.
He remarked, that the subject of the work which he now
presented to his patron was nearly allied to that of the
Dialogue <i>On the Unhappiness of Princes</i>, which he had
formerly dedicated to him, and that it consequently had
a peculiar claim to his protection. He moreover reminded
his illustrious friend, that though in his ecclesiastical capacity
he might be regarded as beyond the reach of misfortune,
yet as the sovereigns of the temporal dominions of the
church, the pontiffs themselves are not exempted from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397"></a>[397]</span>
common lot of mortality; and expressed his persuasion,
that by becoming acquainted with the distresses of his predecessors,
he would learn the salutary lesson of caution.<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>

<p>The opening of the Dialogue <i>On the Vicissitudes of
Fortune</i> is singularly grand and interesting. It exhibits
Poggio and his confidential associate, Antonio Lusco,
fatigued by the inspection of the remains of Roman magnificence,
reposing themselves amidst the venerable ruins of
the capitol, which building commands a prospect of almost
the whole extent of the city. After Antonio has gazed for
a few minutes upon the waste of years, he exclaims with
a sigh, “How unlike, Poggio! is this capitol to that which
Maro sung, as—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Chang’d from horrid thorn to glittering gold.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“The gold has now disappeared, and thorns and briers
resume their reign. When I consider our present situation,
I cannot but remember how Caius Marius, the
pillar of the Roman republic, when he was banished
from his country, landed in Africa, and seated himself
amidst the ruins of Carthage, where he meditated upon
the fate of that city, and could not determine whether
he himself or the rival of Rome afforded a more striking
spectacle of the instability of human things. But
with respect to the devastation of Rome, there is nothing
to which it can be compared. The calamity
which has befallen the mistress of the world exceeds
in magnitude every misfortune recorded in the annals<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398"></a>[398]</span>
of history.—It is a truly lamentable circumstance, that
this city, which formerly produced so many illustrious
heroes and commanders, the parent of such signal virtues,
the nurse of arts, the inventress of military discipline,
the pattern of sanctity, the establisher of laws,
the protectress of good morals, the queen of the nations,
should now, by the injustice of fortune, not only be
stripped of her dignity, but should also be doomed to
the most wretched servitude, and should become so
deformed and abject, as to exhibit no traces of her former
grandeur, except what are to be found in her ruins.”<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>
These observations lead Poggio to remark, how wonderfully
few are the vestiges of ancient art which remain in the
extensive precincts of Rome. Of these vestiges he gives a
complete and interesting catalogue, which affords a very
minute account of the appearance of the ruins of Rome in
the fifteenth century. At the close of this enumeration,
Lusco resumes his reflections on the mutability of Fortune,
on which Poggio inquires of his friend what he means by
that term. In answer to this question, Lusco gives the
Aristotelian definition of Fortune, describing it as an accidental
cause, and says, that those circumstances happen
by Fortune which happen to man contrary to his design and
intention. To this definition he observes that Aquinas
accedes. Poggio, remarking that we speak of the good
fortune of Alexander or Cæsar, though they laid plans to
accomplish what they effected, objects to the foregoing
definition, in the place of which Antonio substitutes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399"></a>[399]</span>
another, which attributes events that are commonly esteemed
fortuitous to the over-ruling providence of God. After this
preliminary conversation, Poggio proceeds briefly to recount
some ancient examples of the mutability of fortune, and then
describes the astonishing success of the arms of Tamerlane,
and the calamities of Bajazet. He then requests Antonio
to detail some of the more modern instances of a calamitous
reverse of circumstances. With this request Lusco complies,
and the instances which he recounts occupy the whole of
the second book of the Dialogue, in which various changes
which had taken place in different parts of Europe, and
particularly in Italy, from the year 1377 to the period of the
death of Martin V. are narrated with great perspicuity and
elegance.—The third book comprises an entertaining epitome
of the history of Italy during the pontificate of
Eugenius IV. The fourth book is not strictly relevant to
the subject of this dialogue, and ought to be considered as
a separate and detached composition. It contains an
account of Persia and India, which Poggio collected from
the narrative of Niccolo Conti, a Venetian, who in the
course of a peregrination of twenty-five years, had penetrated
into the regions situated beyond the Ganges. This
bold adventurer having, during his residence in Arabia,
been obliged to abjure the Christian faith, immediately after
his return to Italy repaired to the pontifical court to solicit
from Eugenius IV. the remission of his sin of apostacy.
On this occasion Poggio procured from him an account of
his route, and of his observations on the manners, customs,
and natural history of the eastern nations. This account
he digested into a narrative, which will be found not a little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400"></a>[400]</span>
amusing by the modern inquirer, and must have excited an
extraordinary degree of attention at the time of its publication.</p>

<p>The Dialogue <i>On the Vicissitudes of Fortune</i> is the
most interesting of the works of Poggio. It inculcates
maxims of sublime philosophy, enforced by a detail of
splendid and striking events. The account which it contains
of the changes which took place in Italy at the end
of the fourteenth, and at the commencement of the fifteenth
centuries, presents a succinct and clear view of the
politics of that period; and the journey of the Venetian
traveller merits the attentive perusal of the curious inquirer
into the history of man.<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401"></a>[401]</span></p>

<p>Soon after the publication of the Dialogue <i>On the
Vicissitudes of Fortune</i>, Poggio gave a striking proof of
the confidence with which he relied on the protection of the
pontiff, by publishing a Dialogue <i>On Hypocrisy</i>. The
astonishing boldness with which he lashes the follies and
vices of the clergy in this composition has been already
noticed. Had he ventured to advance the sentiments which
it contains in the days of Eugenius, he would in all probability
have expiated his temerity by the forfeiture of his
life. The predecessor of Nicolas felt little veneration for
learning, and he united in his character the restlessness of
ambition, and the rigour of religious austerity. As the
manners of a court universally take their complexion from
those of the sovereign, the retinue of Eugenius was crowded
with ecclesiastics who assiduously endeavoured to rise to
preferment by assuming a sanctity of deportment which they
well knew to be the ready passport to the favour of the
pontiff. These men, who attempted to disguise their pride
under the garb of humility, and who, whilst they made a
public profession of excessive piety, secretly indulged themselves
in the grossest debauchery, Poggio had long regarded
with contempt and indignation; and in his Dialogue
<i>On Hypocrisy</i> he attacked them with all the severity of
sarcastic wit. This dialogue he inscribed to one of his
friends, named Francesco Accolti, of Arezzo, a celebrated
lawyer, to whom he observed in his prefatory address,
that as he had formerly endeavoured to display the despicable
nature of Avarice, he had lately undertaken to describe,
in its true colours, Hypocrisy, a vice of a much more odious
complexion. He also intimated to Francesco, that he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402"></a>[402]</span>
fully apprized, that by the publication of the work which
he then transmitted to him, he should give very great
offence; but at the same time he sarcastically remarked, that
they who complained of the severity of his animadversions
would virtually acknowledge themselves guilty of the crime
which it was his intention to hold up to general reprobation.</p>

<p>In the introductory part of the dialogue we are informed,
that Poggio was accustomed to take frequent
journeys to Florence; on which occasions his first visit was
generally paid to Carlo Aretino: that the last time he had
an opportunity of paying his respects to that eminent
scholar, he found him in his library engaged in reading
Plato’s Politia; and that after the customary interchange
of civilities, Carlo, inquiring into the state of the Roman
court, asked him whether it was as much frequented by
hypocrites as it formerly was, during the pontificate of
Eugenius. To this inquiry Poggio answered, that the
reign of hypocrites was come to an end. Carlo rejoicing
in this information, uttered a vehement philippic against
hypocrisy, which, he observed, was more severely reproved
by Jesus Christ than any other vice. Displaying its evil
consequences, he remarked, that hypocrisy tends to destroy
confidence between man and man, and to throw suspicion
on virtue itself.</p>

<p>After the detail of this conversation, Poggio introduces
as a third interlocutor, Jeronimo Aretino, Abbot
of Santa Fiore, an ecclesiastic of considerable learning
and of unblemished manners, who is represented as unexpectedly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403"></a>[403]</span>
paying a visit to Carlo. On the arrival of
Jeronimo, Poggio observes, that as this respectable dignitary
had spent so large a portion of his days amongst
the clergy, he must be well qualified to detail the characteristics
of hypocrisy. This task, however, Jeronimo
declines, as being an invidious one, and attended with
no small degree of danger. But at the solicitation of his
friends, and under the assurance of secrecy, he proceeds
to advert to the derivation of the word <i>hypocrite</i>, which
he defines as a term used to express the idea of a man
who, for the promotion of some evil purpose, pretends
to be what he is not. This definition he observes, includes
not merely pretenders to extraordinary sanctity,
but impostors of every species. Carlo, however, wishes
to limit the meaning of the term to religious deceivers,
whom he thus describes.—“They who assume the appearance
of uncommon sanctimoniousness—who walk the
street with squalid countenances, in thread-bare garments,
and with naked feet—who affect to despise money—who
are continually talking about Jesus Christ—who
wish to be esteemed virtuous, whilst their deeds do not
correspond with their outward appearance—who seduce
foolish women—who quit their cloisters, and travel
up and down the country in quest of fame—who
make an ostentatious display of abstinence—who deceive
and defraud—these men, I think may be justly
denominated hypocrites.” After this description of the
character of a hypocrite, Poggio proposes the question,
whether men who are thus guilty of imposture are not
less dangerous to society than those who openly profess to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404"></a>[404]</span>
despise the obligations of morality; since whatever vices
hypocrites may privately practise, they inculcate upon
others the principles of virtue, and endeavour to palliate
their very crimes by attributing the commission of them
to good motives. This last remark gives Carlo occasion
to detail several scandalous anecdotes of certain ecclesiastics,
who, under the cloak of religious austerity, had indulged
themselves in the most abominable gratification of
their appetites. In the sequel of his speech, Carlo utters
an eloquent invective against the ambition of the clergy
who then frequented the Roman court. Poggio, concurring
with him in sentiment, attacks the popular preachers of
that time. He next animadverts upon the begging friars,
the confessors, and the ecclesiastics who pretend to an
extraordinary degree of temperance and maceration of the
flesh. In speaking of this last description of hypocrites,
he relates an anecdote of an Augustine friar, who undertook
to subsist for eight days upon the holy wafer used in
the Eucharist, and who actually quitted his cell at the
end of the prescribed term in perfectly good health, and
without the least diminution of his corpulency. This
impostor gained great celebrity by his apparently miraculous
abstinence; but after the lapse of some years it was
discovered, that in spite of the vigilance of his guards, he
had conveyed into his apartment a quantity of bread saturated
with wine, which he had injected into his large
leathern girdle, and that he had moreover provided himself
with candles composed of sugar, slightly coated over
with wax, which afforded him a plentiful supply of nourishment.
When Poggio has finished his remarks, Carlo<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405"></a>[405]</span>
attacks the <i>Fratres Observantiæ</i>; and the remainder of
the dialogue is occupied by strictures on the character and
conduct of several individuals, who, during the time of
Poggio’s residence in the Roman court, had distinguished
themselves by the gravity of their demeanour, and by the
sanctity of their religious profession.<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

<p>The talent of sarcastic wit which Poggio displayed
in this dialogue, and in his invectives against Francesco
Filelfo, in all probability caused Nicolas V. to delegate
to him the task of drawing up a philippic against Amedæus
of Savoy, who, under the title of Felix, persisted in
claiming the honours of the pontificate. On the death of
Eugenius, this antipope had endeavoured, by proceeding
to the election of cardinals, and by the mission of embassadors
to several of the Christian powers, to vindicate his
rights, as the only legitimate successor of St. Peter.<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a>
Nicolas, naturally watching the conduct of his competitor
with a jealous eye, not only aimed at his devoted head the
thunders of the church, but threatened to deprive him of
the sovereignty of Savoy, which he destined as the reward
of Charles, king of France, whom he solicited to assist
him in the subjugation of the pertinacious schismatic.<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406"></a>[406]</span>
Eagerly taking up the quarrel of his master, Poggio attacked
the offender in a long invective. A few extracts from
this composition will demonstrate, that in the impartiality
of his acrimony, he did not treat the ducal hermit of
Ripaille with more lenity than he had shewn to the humble
professor of rhetoric.</p>

<p>In his exordium he says, “I cannot suppress the grief
which I feel when I see another Cerberus, whom we
thought to have been lulled asleep, newly roused from the
infernal regions to the disturbance of religion, and the
destruction of the church. For what true believer is
not deeply affected with sorrow, when he beholds a
rapacious wolf, who was formerly fed on the blood of the
faithful, now putting on the semblance of a lamb, for
the purpose of invading, under the guise of humility,
the peace of the church, which he has in vain attacked
by open violence. Who is there that does not lament
that a golden calf, set up by an assembly of abandoned
men, to the disgrace of the faith, in contempt of Christ
and his doctrine, should, under the pretence of peace,
endeavour by his envoys and letters to pervert the minds
of faithful and upright princes from the true belief?—Who
would not call upon God to punish such hypocrisy,
such villany, such baseness? Who would not detest
the perverter of the faith, the enemy of religion, the
author of schism, the high-priest of malignity?—This
is the issue of his affected sanctity of manners, his
relinquishment of the world, his solitary retirement, in
which he pretended to dedicate himself to the service<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407"></a>[407]</span>
of God for the purpose of shamefully demonstrating his
infidelity; in which he arrayed himself in humble apparel,
in order that he might afterwards, like a roaring lion seeking
whom he might devour, destroy all religion, excite
a schism, and rend the unseamed garment of Christ.”</p>

<p>Having thus put in a railing accusation against Amedæus,
Poggio proceeded to utter a philippic against the
members of the council of Basil, who had attempted to raise
him to the pontificate. “I wonder,” says he, “that any
one is so void of understanding as to believe, that any
thing good could proceed from that sink of iniquity,
the synagogue of Basil. Is there any one so foolish as
to imagine, that this conventicle of reprobates could produce
any thing but a monstrous birth, or that it has any
authority to ordain the meanest priest, much less to
create a pontiff, except the authority which it may have
derived from the devil and his followers? For who,”
says he, “is ignorant of the character of that tumultuary
band of most debauched men? Who does not know
what sort of people, how nefarious, how abandoned,
how wicked, were assembled in that sink of iniquity?—apostates,
fornicators, ravishers, deserters, men convicted
of the most shameful crimes, blasphemers, rebels against
God and their superiors.”</p>

<p>From such an assembly as this, Poggio observed, that
nothing salutary could proceed, since a bad tree can never
bring forth wholesome fruit. After ridiculing the steps
which Amedæus had taken to establish his authority, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408"></a>[408]</span>
charging him with endeavouring to promote his own interest
by the arts of corruption, he reminded him that he was
now deserted by the few partizans who had formerly espoused
his cause, and that all the princes of Christendom had
declared themselves in favour of Nicolas. “Since this is
the case,” continued he, “what have you left but empty
hopes? Why then do you trouble kings and princes?
why do you continue to weary their ears, and to tempt
them by your evil practices? why do you call all people
your sons, when nobody acknowledges you as a father?
Awake from your long slumber, and consider that you
were once a Christian. Return to that Saviour whom
you have renounced. Peter, the chief of the apostles,
once denied his Lord, and obtained pardon by a confession
of his crime. Imitate his contrition, and acknowledge
that you have sinned against the Lord. No longer
wish to deceive yourself or the people of Christ. Confess
that you are what you are. Resume your ancient manners
and your former life: enter upon a train of thought
worthy of a good man: return into favour with God,
and gain the good will of men: cast off the burthen of
conscience which must of necessity weigh heavy upon you
day and night: begin to be wise in your old age: lay
aside foreign ornaments, and divest yourself with a good
grace of the honours which you have so basely seized:
consult for your reputation, your honour, and the dignity
of your hoary hairs. Consider for a moment what men
say and think of you. All the world execrates the
schism, and you the sower and instigator of it. Wash
away then this stain, this disgrace to your family. Suffer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409"></a>[409]</span>
not posterity to abhor you as the origin of strife. If you
contemn the judgment of men, if you despise infamy,
yet remember that God suffers no wicked action to pass
unpunished. Remember, that if you do not repent, you
will incur the pain of damnation. Other punishments
are comparatively light, because they endure but for a
season. But the soul, when once lost, is lost to all
eternity; and unless you repent, you will be doomed,
with other heresiarchs, to sustain the horrors of everlasting
fire.”<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a></p>

<p>These animadversions of Poggio upon the conduct of
Amedæus and his abettors, were calculated to inflame
resentment rather than to prepare the way for conciliation.
The pacific spirit of Nicolas suggested measures much more
conducive to the extinction of the schism. By the grant of
a cardinal’s hat, and the privilege of precedence in the
conclave, the antipope was induced to renounce the
equivocal honours which he held by so dubious a title, and
to render homage to his rival, as the true successor of St.
Peter. After the fulfilment of these terms of pacification,
which were concluded in the year 1449, Amedæus retired to
his hermitage of Ripaille, where he devoted the remainder
of his days to works of piety, and in the neighbourhood of
which he terminated his mortal career on the seventh of
January, 1451.<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410"></a>[410]</span></p>

<p>Nicolas being thus freed from the vexation and apprehension
which had been excited in his mind by the claims
of his rival, applied himself with renewed spirit to the
promotion of classical learning. At his request, and under
his patronage, the scholars who frequented his court
applied themselves with the most earnest assiduity to the
study of the Greek tongue. Among the rest, Poggio contributed
to the illustration of Grecian literature, by publishing
a Latin version of the work of Diodorus Siculus,<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>
which he dedicated to his revered patron. This was not,
however, his first essay as a translator from the Greek.
A little before the accession of Nicolas to the pontificate
he had translated into Latin the Cyropædia of Xenophon.<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a>
Having completed this task, he deliberated for some time
on the choice of a patron under whose auspices he might
submit it to the inspection of the learned. At length the
fame of the splendid talents and liberal disposition of
Alfonso, king of Naples, determined him to inscribe his
translation to that monarch.<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> On this occasion some of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_411"></a>[411]</span>
the Neapolitan scholars, who regarded Poggio with a considerable
degree of animosity, gratified their malevolence, by
vilifying his work to the king, who seems to have lent too
ready an ear to their censures. Poggio highly resented
this conduct of Alfonso, whom he stigmatized in a letter to
Bartolomeo Facio, one of the learned men who enjoyed
that monarch’s favour and protection,<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> as a prince who, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_412"></a>[412]</span>
consequence of his own ignorance, gave implicit credit to
the opinions of others, and declared, that he would avail
himself of the earliest opportunity to retract every thing
which he had said in his commendation.<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> It should appear,
that these remonstrances of Poggio produced an effect little
to be expected to arise from the threats of an author
against a sovereign prince. In process of time, Alfonso,
being convinced that the strictures of his critics were inspired
by personal hostility rather than by justice, remunerated
him for his version, by a donation which exceeded his
first and most sanguine hopes.<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a></p>

<p>The indignant manner in which Poggio commented
on the cool reception which his version of the Cyropædia
had experienced at the court of Naples evinced, that the
influence of age had not abated his spirit. Indeed the
unrestrained license of his speech about this time betrayed
him into a contest with one of his fellow-labourers in the
field of literature, in which he appears to have manifested
not only the petulance, but also the prowess of youth. The
antagonist whom he encountered on this occasion was George<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413"></a>[413]</span>
of Trebisond, a native of the isle of Candia, who adopted
the designation of <i>Trapezuntius</i>, or of Trebisond, in
reference to the residence of his ancestors. He was induced
to quit the place of his nativity by the invitation of Francesco
Barbaro, who on his arrival in Italy procured him the
honour of being enrolled amongst the citizens of Venice.<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a>
Having made a competent progress in the knowledge of the
Latin tongue, he went to Padua, and afterwards to Vicenza,
in which latter city he was employed in the capacity of
public tutor.<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> His residence in Vicenza was however not of
long duration. Finding himself harrassed by the intrigues
of Guarino Veronese, who regarded him with sentiments of
determined hostility, he gave up his professorship, and
repaired to Rome, in which city he arrived in the year
1430.<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> His Venetian friends having recommended him to
the protection of Eugenius IV., that pontiff conferred upon
him the office of apostolic secretary. He continued to hold
this office under Nicolas V., who employed him in translating
the works of various Greek authors. When, however,
Nicolas had assembled at his court the most accomplished
scholars of the time, who were able to detect the errors of
literary pretenders by the touchstone of enlightened criticism,
the reputation of George of Trebisond began rapidly
to decline.<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> This circumstance probably had an unhappy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_414"></a>[414]</span>
effect upon his temper, and by rendering him apt to take
offence, prepared the way for his quarrel with Poggio. This
quarrel he certainly took up on very slight grounds; namely,
an opinion expressed by Poggio in a letter to a friend, that
he had without just reason charged Guarino Veronese with
attacking him in an anonymous epistle. This remark drew
from the Trapezuntian an angry written remonstrance, to
which Poggio replied with exemplary forbearance. Here
the matter might have rested, had not a dispute arisen
between the two secretaries about a sum of money which
fell to them in common. The discussions to which this
affair gave rise were carried on by Poggio with a praise-worthy
frankness and generosity of spirit; whilst his antagonist,
in the bitterness of his feeling, tried to overwhelm
him by an accusation of practising against his life, which he
embodied in a letter to their common master. By this proceeding
George found the mind of the pontiff so much
alienated from him, that he thought it expedient to quit the
Roman court. He accordingly retired to Naples, where he
was honourably received by king Alfonso. But in the year
1453, the good offices of Filelfo restored him to the favour
of Nicolas V., who reinstated him in his ancient situation in
the Roman chancery.<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></p>

<p>George of Trebisond was not the only member of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415"></a>[415]</span>
court of Nicolas V. whom Poggio regarded with sentiments
of enmity. Tommaso da Rieti, a man of infamous character,
who by his interposition had been refused admittance
into the Roman chancery, and whom, under the designation
of <i>Eques Reatinus</i>, he had stigmatized in the letter to
Lionello d’Este, which is quoted in the ninth chapter of
this work, having provoked him to hostility, he composed an
invective against him, a copy of which is still extant in the
Laurentian Library.<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p>

<p>In the year 1450, the celebration of the Jubilee
attracted to Rome a prodigious concourse of people. As
the plague was at this time raging in various parts of Italy,
the multitude of devotees who were assembled to assist at
the splendid solemnities of this festive season rendered the
pontifical capital a focus of infection.<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> As soon therefore
as Nicolas had finished the customary religious exercises,
he fled from the impending danger to Fabriano, a town
situated in the Marca d’Ancona. Poggio availed himself
of this opportunity to visit his native place, where he dedicated
his leisure to the prosecution of his studies, and to
the enjoyment of social intercourse with his surviving Tuscan
friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_416"></a>[416]</span></p>

<p>It was during this season of relaxation from the duties
of his office, that he published what may be called the first
edition of his <i>Liber Facetiarum</i>, or Collection of Jocose
Tales.<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> In the preface to this curious miscellany he
intimates, that he had engaged in a work of such levity,
with a view of exercising himself in Latin composition.<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a>
The recording of these witticisms revived in his recollection
the occurrence of days of pleasure which were past, never
to return. From the postscript to the <i>Liber Facetiarum</i>
we learn, that during the pontificate of Martin V. the
officers of the Roman chancery were accustomed to assemble
in a kind of common hall. In this apartment, which from
the nature of the conversation of its frequenters, who were
much more studious of wit than of truth, acquired the name
of <i>Bugiale</i>;<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> they discussed the news of the day, and
amused themselves by the communication of entertaining
anecdotes. On these occasions they indulged themselves
in the utmost latitude of satiric remark, dealing out their
sarcasms with such impartiality, that they did not spare
even the pontiff himself. The leading orators of the
Bugiale were Razello of Bologna, Antonio Lusco,<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> Cincio,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417"></a>[417]</span>
and Poggio; and the pointed jests and humorous stories
which occurred in the course of the unrestrained conversations,
in which these mirthful scribes bore a principal part,
furnished the greater portion of the materials for the <i>Liber
Facetiarum</i>.<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a></p>

<p>This work is highly interesting on account of the
anecdotes which it contains of several eminent men, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418"></a>[418]</span>
flourished during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.
In the course of its perusal, we find that many an humorous
tale, which the modern jester narrates as the account of
circumstances that occurred under his own observation,
were of the number of those which caused the walls of
the <i>Bugiale</i> to re-echo with laughter. Like all collections
of the kind, the <i>Liber Facetiarum</i> contains, amongst a
number of pieces of merit, some stories, in which we look
in vain for the pungency of wit. When, however, we are
inclined to condemn Poggio as guilty of the crime of
chronicling a dull joke, we should remember, that <i>bons
mots</i> frequently borrow their interest from aptness of introduction,
and an humorous mode of delivery; and that
though the spirit of a witticism, which enlivened the conversation
of a Lusco or a Cincio, may evaporate when it is
committed to paper, yet at the time when it was recorded
by Poggio, it sported in his recollection with all the hilarity
of its concomitant circumstances. But too many of the
<i>Facetiæ</i> are liable to a more serious objection than that of
dulness. It is a striking proof of the licentiousness of the
times, that an apostolic secretary, who enjoyed the friendship
and esteem of the pontiff, should have published a number
of stories which outrage the laws of decency, and put
modesty to the blush; and that the dignitaries of the Roman
hierarchy should have tolerated a book, various passages of
which tend not merely to expose the ignorance and hypocrisy
of individuals of the clerical profession, but to throw
ridicule on the most sacred ceremonies of the Catholic
church. Recanati indeed endeavours to defend the fame of
Poggio, by suggesting the idea, that many of the most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419"></a>[419]</span>
licentious stories were added to his collection by posterior
writers; and he supports this opinion by asserting, that he
has seen two manuscript copies of the <i>Facetiæ</i>, in which
many of the obnoxious passages in question are not to be
found.<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> The validity of this defence is, however, rendered
extremely questionable by the consideration of a fact, of
which Recanati was probably ignorant, namely, that Lorenzo
Valla, in the fourth book of his <i>Antidotus in
Poggium</i>, which was published about the year 1452, not
only impeaches the <i>Facetiæ</i> of blasphemy and indecency;
but recites, by way of holding that work up to reprobation,
the most scandalous stories which are now to be found in
the whole collection.<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a></p>

<p>It has been ascertained by Monsieur le Grand, that a
few of the stories which occur in the <i>Facetiæ</i> are to be
found in the <i>Fabliaux</i>, or tales which were circulated in
various parts of Europe by the Provençal bards of the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries, whose sportive effusions of
fancy furnished a rich fund of materials for the poets and
novelists of Italy and of England.<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_420"></a>[420]</span></p>

<p>The <i>Liber Facetiarum</i>, soon after its publication,
acquired a considerable degree of popularity, and was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_421"></a>[421]</span>
eagerly read, not only in the native country of its author,
but also in France, in Spain, in Germany, and in Britain.<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422"></a>[422]</span>
This is by no means a surprising circumstance. Wit and
humour possess almost irresistible charms. The idle and
the dissipated are pleased with a sally of hilarity, which
gives a stimulus to their fancy; and they who are habituated
to study, or who are fatigued by the more weighty
concerns of life, are happy to enjoy an opportunity of
occasional relaxation. As a vehicle of sentiment, a book
may be considered as the representative of its author; and
in a world of anxiety and trouble, he who is endued with
the happy talent of causing the wrinkle of care to give place
to the pleasing convulsion of mirth, will find few circles of
society in which he is not a welcome guest.</p>

<p>In the <i>Facetiæ</i> Poggio aimed a most mischievous
thrust at his old antagonist, Filelfo, by making him the hero
of a tale, the ridiculous oddity of which disturbs the steady
countenance of gravity itself, and causes the strictest
severity for a moment to smile at the indelicacy which it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_423"></a>[423]</span>
condemns.<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> The war between these redoubted champions
was carried on till the year 1453, when they were reconciled
by the interposition of their common friend, Pietro Tommasi.<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a></p>

<p>During Poggio’s temporary residence at Terranuova,
he was one day visited by Benedetto Aretino, a civilian
of distinguished reputation; by Niccolo di Foligni, a
physician of considerable eminence;<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> and by Carlo Aretino,
the chancellor of the Florentine republic. These guests
Poggio hospitably entertained in his villa; and from the
conversation which occurred after their repast, he collected
materials for a work which he dedicated, in the
year 1451, under the title of <i>Historia disceptativa convivialis</i>,
to the cardinal Prospero Colonna. This work
consists of three parts, the subject of the first of which is
not a little whimsical, namely—Whether the master of a
feast ought to thank his guests for the honour of their
company, or whether the guests should express their gratitude
to their host for his hospitality. The discussion of
this singular question does not afford any thing very interesting.
The second part contains the detail of a dispute
which took place between Niccolo di Foligni and Benedetto
Aretino, on the comparative dignity of their respective
professions. Niccolo, pleading on behalf of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_424"></a>[424]</span>
healing art, observes, that if antiquity can confer honour,
the practice of medicine existed in times so remote, that
its first professors are enrolled amongst the number of the
Gods. He also maintains, that the medical profession must
needs be more honourable than the profession of law,
since the doctrines of medicine are built upon the principles
of science, whilst the maxims of law depend upon
caprice; and that of course physicians are obliged to
qualify themselves for the discharge of their duty by
diligent researches into the fixed and established course of
nature; whilst those who are esteemed learned in the law
confine their researches to their professional books. With
regard to the civil law in particular, he reminds Benedetto,
that there are few states which are regulated by its dictates;
whereas the inhabitants of almost all the nations in the
world pay homage to the professors of the healing art, by
having recourse to their assistance. Niccolo having finished
his arguments, Benedetto undertakes the defence of legal
studies, and asserts the high antiquity of laws, which he
maintains must have existed before the practice of medicine,
since medicine could not have been reduced to a science
before the assemblage of men in civil communities, which
are held together by the bonds of law. He also maintains
the dignity of laws, as being the conclusions of reason,
and the support of society. Niccolo, in reply, denies that
the civil law is the result of the conclusions of reason, and
vilifies it as a crude collection of regulations, adopted to
suit the exigencies of the moment, without any reference
to natural law, which civilians do not study—as a mass of
opinions and not a collection of truths. Impeaching the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_425"></a>[425]</span>
general character of the professors of law, he accuses them
of an inordinate thirst for gain, which leads them to nourish
strife, to prolong discord by the tediousness of legal
proceedings, and to pride themselves on their success in
patronizing a bad cause. Benedetto, roused by these
pointed reflections, observes, that it ill becomes a physician
to treat with severity the characters of the professors of
law; “for,” says he, “what is more notorious than the
folly of many of your brethren, who kill more than
they cure, and build their art upon experiments made
at the risk of their wretched patients? The errors of
lawyers are of trivial consequence, in comparison with
those of physicians. Our unskilfulness empties the
purses of our clients, but your mistakes endanger the
lives of those who employ you. We cause somebody
to be the gainer, whilst you both rob a man of his life,
and defraud his surviving relations of the amount of your
fees. Whilst we may possibly occasion the loss of a legacy,
or an inheritance, you disturb the peace of nations by
slaying kings and princes. And let me ask, what dignity
is there in your profession? You are called in to visit a
patient—you examine his natural discharges, wrinkle
your brows, and assume a countenance of uncommon
gravity, in order to persuade the bye-standers, that he
is in a very critical situation. Then you feel his pulse,
in order to ascertain the powers of nature. After this
you hold a consultation, and write your prescription, in
the composition of which you are not guided by any
fixed rules, as is plain from the different receipts which
are in the same case recommended by different practitioners.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426"></a>[426]</span>
If your potion happen by chance to be followed
by good symptoms, you extol the cure as a marvellous effect
of art; but if it does any mischief, all the blame is laid
on the poor patient. I will relate to you a curious
circumstance which happened to one Angelo, a bishop
of Arezzo. This ecclesiastic being afflicted by a very
dangerous disorder, was told by his physicians, that if
he would not take the potions which they prescribed, he
would run the risk of losing his life. He for some time
positively refused to take their nauseous draughts, but
was at length persuaded by his friends to conform to the
instructions of his doctors. The physicians then sent him
a number of phials, all of which he emptied into a certain
utensil, which was deposited under his bed. In the morning
the physicians paid him another visit, and finding him
almost free from his fever, intimated to him, that they
hoped he was convinced of his folly in having so long
refused to follow their prescriptions. To this remark he
replied—the effect of your medicines is indeed marvellous,
for by merely putting them under my bed I
have recovered my health. If I had swallowed them, no
doubt I should have become immortal.”<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> After the narration
of this anecdote, Benedetto proceeds to enlarge upon
the utility of laws, which he maintains to have been the
foundation of the dignity of states and empires. This position
is denied by Niccolo, who asserts, that the dominions
of monarchs and republics have constantly been extended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_427"></a>[427]</span>
by power, which is so incompatible with law, that the powerful
and mighty universally despise all legal obligations, which
are binding only on the poor and humble.</p>

<p>In the third part of the <i>Historia disceptativa convivialis</i>
Poggio discusses the question, whether the Latin
language was universally spoken by the Romans, or whether
the learned made use of a language different from that of
the vulgar. Poggio maintains, in opposition to the opinion
of his deceased friend, Leonardo Aretino,<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> and others, that
the language used by the well-educated Romans was the
vernacular language of their country, and that it differed
from that of the lower classes in no other respect, than as
the language of the well-educated in every country is more
elegant and polished than that of the inferior orders of the
community. In defence of his opinion, he quotes a considerable
number of curious passages from the Roman
historians and rhetoricians, which clearly prove his point,
and evince his profound acquaintance with Latin literature.</p>

<p>The discussion of the comparative dignity of the professions
of medicine and civil law naturally led to satirical
remarks on the part of the respective interlocutors, on the
abuse of those two branches of science; and the perusal of
this dialogue will serve to shew that its author was fully
competent to expose the pompous ignorances of empirics,
and to display the detriment which arises to society from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_428"></a>[428]</span>
those most mischievous of knaves, the unprincipled practitioners
of the law. It must also be allowed, that the enumeration
which Benedetto Aretino and Niccolo di Foglini
set forth of the merits of their respective professions,
forcibly inculcates the benefits which accrue to mankind
from the study of medicine and of jurisprudence, and the
true principles upon which those studies ought to be conducted.<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a>
The following letter, which Poggio addressed to
his friend Benedetto, in the year 1436, demonstrates, that
the result of his serious meditations had convinced him that
legal practice was not only compatible with moral rectitude,
but was most likely to be productive of gain when regulated
by the dictates of integrity.</p>

<p>“I have been highly gratified, my dear Benedetto, by
your kind letter; and I cannot but admire the versatility
of your genius, who have united to the most profound
knowledge of the civil law, an elegance and grace of
expression, which entitles you, in my opinion, to as high
a rank in the school of rhetoric, as you hold among the
professors of the science of jurisprudence. It is indeed a
proof of an extraordinary capacity, and of a wonderful
proficiency in letters, to have successfully cultivated two
departments of knowledge, the cultivation of each of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_429"></a>[429]</span>
which is attended with no small degree of difficulty.
The acquisition of the knowledge of the civil law is a
work of immense labour, on account of the discordance
of sentiments which occurs amongst those who have
treated upon this subject, but still more on account of the
almost endless volumes written by commentators, which
distract the minds of their readers by the difference of
opinions which they contain, and weary them by the
prolixity of their style. Far from imbibing the neatness
and elegance of the old lawyers, these commentators, by
their perplexity and minute distinctions, shut up the
road to truth. The difficulty of attaining the graces of
eloquence is evinced by the fact, that in all ages truly
eloquent writers are very few in number. When therefore
I see you endowed with both these accomplishments, I
congratulate you on your having bestowed your labour on
pursuits which will confer upon you both honour and
emolument. For your knowledge of the law will bestow
upon you riches, which are the necessary support of
human life; and the study of polite letters will be highly
ornamental to you, and will tend to improve and display
to the best advantage your legal talents.</p>

<p>“I would wish you to avoid the common error of
too many legal practitioners, who, for the sake of
money, wrest the law to the purposes of injustice.
It has, indeed, always happened, that the bad have been
more in number than the good, and the old proverb
justly says, that excellence is of rare occurrence. Almost
all law students, when they enter upon their profession, are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_430"></a>[430]</span>
stimulated by a love of gain; and by making gain the
object of their unremitted pursuit, they acquire a habit
of appreciating the merits of a cause, not according to
the rules of equity, but according to the probability of
profit. When there is no prospect of emolument, justice
is disregarded, and the richer client is considered as having
the better cause. As many tradesmen imagine, that they
can make no profit without telling falsehoods in commendation
of their commodities, so the generality of men
learned in the law think they shall never prosper in the
world if they scruple to subvert justice by perjury, and
equity by sophisms. Acting on these principles, they do
not endeavour to investigate the true nature of a cause,
but at all hazards try to promote the views of the party
who engages their services by a fee. But I am persuaded
that you, who are by your excellent disposition instigated
no less by a love of virtue than by a passion for literature,
will act upon different principles, and will esteem nothing
lawful which is dishonourable. I would not, however, tie
you down by the strictness of that philosophy which,
making happiness to consist in virtue alone, inculcates a
contempt for worldly emoluments; for those who enter
upon civil life will find the want of many comforts. Indeed
there have been more lovers than despisers of riches
amongst philosophers themselves; and the advice of those
who exhort us quietly to submit to poverty is rather to
be praised than followed; for it is truly melancholy to
depend upon the assistance of others. But you have no
reason to fear that by being honest you will become poor.
On the contrary, by acting up to the principles of integrity,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_431"></a>[431]</span>
you will surpass others in wealth as well as in
dignity. It will in the end be found much more profitable
to have the reputation of honesty and justice, than that
of skilfulness and craft. Virtue is valued even by the
vicious, and extorts commendation from those who are
unwilling to obey her precepts. It is impossible, in the
nature of things, that he who has established a reputation
for uprightness should not excel others in honour, in
authority, and in emoluments. I would wish you, therefore,
in the first place, to persevere in the practice of
virtue, then to apply yourself with all diligence to the
study of the law, and lastly, to add to these accomplishments
the graces of polite learning. If you adopt this
plan, you will not be doomed to struggle against the inconveniences
of an humble station, but you will rise
through the intermediate degrees of dignity to the highest
stations of honour.”<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a></p>

</div>

<p>On the twenty-fourth of April, 1453, a vacancy was
occasioned in the chancellorship of the Tuscan republic,
by the death of Carlo Aretino.<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> In this conjuncture the
long established literary reputation of Poggio, and the
predominant interest of the house of Medici, concurred,
without any canvassing or intriguing on his part, in directing
to him the choice of his fellow-citizens, and he was
elected to the office which had been in succession so ably
filled by two of his most intimate friends. The prospect
of the distinguished honours which awaited him in his
native province did not, however, so entirely occupy his
mind, as to render him insensible of the sacrifice which
he made in quitting the Roman chancery, in which he had
held situations of confidence and dignity for the space of
fifty-one years. His heart was depressed with sorrow when
he bade farewell to the pontiff, from whose kindness he
had uniformly experienced the most friendly indulgence.
Amongst the associates of his literary and official labours,
there were moreover some chosen companions of his hours
of relaxation, whose pleasing converse he could not forego<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_436"></a>[436]</span>
without yielding to the emotions of grief. But in Florence
also he had been from his early years accustomed to enjoy
the pleasures of friendship; and the sentiments of patriotism
concurred with the voice of ambition in prompting
him to obey the call of his country. In addition to these
motives, he was prompted to accept this lucrative employment
by a sense of the duty which he owed to his family,
for whose welfare, as he himself says, he deemed himself
bound to sacrifice his own ease and liberty. He therefore
quitted the city of Rome in the month of June, 1453;
and having removed his family to the Tuscan capital, where
he was received with a welcome which he compares to that
experienced by Cicero on his return from exile, he applied
himself with his wonted diligence to the duties of his new
office.<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a></p>

<p>He had not long resided In Florence before he
received an additional testimony of the esteem of his fellow-citizens,
in being elected into the number of the <i>Priori
degli arti</i>, or presidents of the trading companies, the
establishment of which was happily calculated to secure the
preservation of good order, and to defend from infringement
the political privileges of the people.<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></p>

<p>On his arrival in Florence, Poggio found his countrymen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_437"></a>[437]</span>
involved in the embarrassments and distresses incident
to a state of war. Soon after Francesco Sforza had made
himself master of the city of Milan, he had been attacked
by the united forces of the Venetians and the king of
Naples. The Florentines being invited to join in the
alliance against him, had, at the instance of Cosmo
de’ Medici, not only refused to take any share in the
confederacy, but had sent a body of troops to his assistance.
Irritated by this conduct, the Venetians and the Neapolitan
king expelled from their respective dominions all the
Tuscans who happened to reside there for the purposes of
commerce. This insult was the forerunner of hostilities,
which were commenced in the year 1451 by the king of
Naples, who sent his son Ferdinando, at the head of an
army of twelve thousand men, to invade the Tuscan territories.
The Neapolitan forces made themselves masters
of a few unimportant towns, but they were prevented by
the vigilance of their adversaries from gaining any signal
or permanent advantage. The war was for some time
carried on in a languid manner, till the Florentines and
the duke of Milan having procured the assistance of
Charles VII., king of France, the Venetians, after sustaining
great reverses of fortune, were inclined to an
accommodation; and without the concurrence of the king
of Naples, they entered into a negotiation with their
enemies, which was happily terminated at Lodi on the
ninth of April, 1454, by the signature of a treaty of peace.
Alfonso was greatly irritated by the defection of his allies,
and for some time obstinately persisted in refusing to
listen to pacific overtures. But on the twenty-sixth of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_438"></a>[438]</span>
January, 1455, he was persuaded to accede to the treaty of
Lodi by the earnest solicitation of Nicolas V.<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a></p>

<p>The intelligence of this happy event diffused a beam
of cheerfulness over the latter days of that benevolent
pontiff, who had for a long space of time struggled with
a complication of painful disorders. In the midst of his
sufferings, however, he did not remit his endeavours to
promote the welfare of Christendom. He was busily
employed in making preparations to send succour to the
Greeks, who were sinking beneath the power of the Turks,
when he terminated his career of glory on the 24th of
March, 1455.<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a></p>

<p>Nicolas V. was one of the brightest ornaments of the
pontifical throne. In the exercise of authority over the
ecclesiastical dominions he exhibited a happy union of the
virtues of gentleness and firmness. Purely disinterested
in his views, he did not lavish upon his relatives the wealth
which the prudent administration of his finances poured
into his coffers; but appropriated the revenues of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_439"></a>[439]</span>
church to the promotion of its dignity. The gorgeous
solemnity which graced his performance of religious rites
evinced his attention to decorum and the grandeur of his taste.
In the superb edifices which were erected under his auspices,
the admiring spectator beheld the revival of ancient magnificence.
As the founder of the Vatican library he claims the
homage of the lovers of classic literature. His court was
the resort of the learned, who found in him a discriminating
patron, and a generous benefactor. It was the subject of
general regret, that the brief term of his pontificate prevented
the maturing of the mighty plans which he had
conceived for the encouragement of the liberal arts. When
his lifeless remains were consigned to the grave, the friends
of peace lamented the premature fate of a pontiff, who had
assiduously laboured to secure the tranquillity of Italy; and
they who were sensible of the charms of enlightened piety
regretted the loss of a true father of the faithful, who
had dedicated his splendid talents to the promotion of the
temporal as well as the spiritual welfare of the Christian
community.</p>

<p>Had Poggio by his intercourse with Nicolas V. imbibed
a portion of the meekness of spirit which influenced
the conduct of that amiable patron of literature, he would
have provided for his present comfort and for his future
fame. But he unfortunately indulged, to the latest period of
his life, that bitterness of resentment, and that intemperance
of language, which disgraced his strictures on
Francesco Filelfo. When he quitted the Roman chancery
he did not depart in peace with all his colleagues. At the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_440"></a>[440]</span>
time of his removal to Florence he was engaged in the
violence of literary hostility against the celebrated Lorenzo
Valla. In Lorenzo he had to contend with a champion of
no inferior fame—a champion whose dexterity in controversy
had been increased by frequent exercise. This zealous
disputant was the son of a doctor of civil law, and was
born at Rome towards the end of the fourteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a>
He was educated in his native city, and when he had attained
the age of twenty-four years he offered himself as a
candidate for the office of apostolic secretary, which, as he
himself asserts, he was prevented from obtaining by the
intrigues of Poggio.<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> Quitting Rome in consequence of
his disappointment, he repaired to Piacenza for the purpose
of receiving an inheritance which had devolved to him
on the recent death of his grandfather and his uncle.<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a>
From Piacenza he removed to Pavia, in the university of
which city he for some time read lectures on rhetoric.<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a>
The history of the transactions in which he was engaged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_441"></a>[441]</span>
immediately after his removal from Pavia is involved in
considerable obscurity. But it is clearly ascertained, that
about the year 1435 he was honoured by the patronage of
Alfonso, king of Naples, whom he appears to have accompanied
in his warlike expeditions. Soon after the translation
of the pontifical court from Florence to Rome in the
year 1443, Valla returned to his native city. His residence
in Rome was not, however, of long continuance. About
the time of the dissolution of the council of Florence, he
had written a treatise to prove the erroneousness of the
commonly received opinion, that the city of Rome had
been presented to the sovereign pontiffs by the emperor
Constantine.<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> The officious malice of some fiery zealots
having apprized Eugenius IV. of the nature and object of
this treatise, the wrath of that pontiff was kindled against
its author, who, being obliged to fly from the rage of religious
bigotry, took refuge in Naples, where he was kindly
received by his royal protector.</p>

<p>During his residence in Naples, Valla delivered public
lectures on eloquence, which were attended by crowded
audiences. But the imprudence of his zeal in the correction
of vulgar errors in matters of theological belief again
involved him in dangers and difficulties. He appears to
have possessed that superiority of intellect above his contemporaries,
which, when united to a warm temper and a
propensity to disputation, never fails to draw down upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_442"></a>[442]</span>
the inquisitive the hatred of fanaticism. In the pride of
superior knowledge, he provoked the indignation of the
bishop of Majorca, by asserting that the pretended letter of
Christ to Abgarus was a forgery.<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> In aggravation of this
heresy, he had moreover derided the assertion of a preaching
friar, who had inculcated upon his audience the commonly
received notion, that the formulary of faith, generally
known by the name of the apostles’ creed, was the joint
composition of those first heralds of salvation.<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> The freedom
with which he descanted upon these delicate topics of
dispute exposed him to the utmost peril. His enemies
publicly arraigned him before a spiritual tribunal, where he
underwent a strict examination; and it is very probable,
that had not Alfonso interposed the royal authority on his
behalf, not even a recantation of his imputed errors would
have saved him from the severe punishment which the atrocity
of religious bigotry has allotted to those who deviate
from the narrow line of orthodox faith.<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></p>

<p>Theology was not the only subject of investigation
which involved Valla in altercation and strife. Literary
jealousy kindled the flame of hostility between him and
Beccatelli, whom he attacked in a violent invective.
With Bartolomeo Facio also he maintained a controversy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_443"></a>[443]</span>
in the course of which he manifested the utmost bitterness
of spirit.<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></p>

<p>When Nicolas V. had ascended the papal throne,
Valla received from that liberally-minded pontiff an invitation
to fix his residence in Rome. He accordingly
repaired to the pontifical court, where he was honourably
received, and employed in translating the Greek authors
into the Latin tongue.<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> Soon after his arrival in Rome,
the following circumstance gave rise to the irreconcilable
enmity which took place between him and Poggio. A
Catalonian nobleman, a pupil of Valla, happened to be
possessed of a copy of Poggio’s epistles. This book having
fallen into Poggio’s hands, he observed on its margin
several annotations, pointing out alleged barbarisms in his
style. Fired with indignation at this attack upon his
Latinity, and precipitately concluding that the author of
these criticisms could be no other than Valla himself, whose
<i>Libri Elegantiarum Linguæ Latinæ</i> had gained him the
reputation of an acute grammarian, he had immediate
recourse to his accustomed mode of revenge, and assailed
the supposed delinquent in a fierce invective. In this work<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_444"></a>[444]</span>
he accused Valla of the most offensive arrogance, which, as
he asserted, was manifested in his animadversions on the
style of the best classic authors. Poggio then proceeded to
examine and to defend the passages which had been noted
with reprobation in the young Catalonian’s copy of his
epistles. Collecting courage as he proceeded, he arraigned
at the bar of critical justice several forms of expression
which occur in Valla’s <i>Elegantiæ</i>. Alluding to Valla’s
transactions in the court of Naples, he impeached him of
heresy both in religion and philosophy, and concluded his
strictures by the sketch of a ridiculous triumphal procession,
which, as he asserted, would well befit the vanity and folly
of his antagonist.<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a></p>

<p>In the course of a little time after the publication of
this invective, Valla addressed to Nicolas V. an answer to
it, under the title of <i>Antidotus in Poggium</i>. In the introduction
to this defence of himself, he asserted, that Poggio
had been stimulated to attack him by envy of the favourable
reception which his <i>Elegantiæ</i> had received from the
public. Adverting to the advanced age of his opponent,
he addressed to him a long and grave admonition on the
acerbity of his language. After a sufficient quantity of
additional preliminary observations, Valla proceeded to
rebut the charge which Poggio had brought against him.
He asserted, that the critic who had given such offence
to the irritable secretary was the above-mentioned Catalonian
nobleman, who, taking umbrage at an expression<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_445"></a>[445]</span>
derogatory to the taste of his countrymen, which occurred
in one of Poggio’s epistles, had avenged himself by making
some cursory strictures on his style.<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> By shewing that the
criticisms in question by no means agreed with the principles
inculcated in his <i>Elegantiæ</i>, and by other internal evidence,
Valla proved almost to demonstration, that he himself had
no part in the animadversions which had excited so much
animosity. Having thus repelled the imputation of a
wanton and insidious aggression, he proceeded to shew,
that he had not abstained from criticising the works of
Poggio on account of their freedom from faults, by entering
upon a most minute and rigid examination of their
phraseology; an examination in which he gave ample proof
how acute is the eye of enmity, and how peculiarly well
qualified a rival is to discover the errors of his competitor.</p>

<p>Had Valla in his <i>Antidotus</i> restrained himself within
the limits of self-defence, he would have gained the praise
due to the exercise of the virtue of forbearance: had he proceeded
no farther in offensive operations than to impugn the
style of his opponent, he would have been justified in the
opinion of mankind in general, as exercising the right of
retaliation. But by attacking the moral character of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_446"></a>[446]</span>
Poggio,<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> he imprudently roused in the fiery bosom of his
adversary the fierceness of implacable resentment, and
provoked him to open wide the flood-gates of abuse. In a
second invective Poggio maintained, that if it were true
that the Catalonian youth wrote the remarks which were the
subject of his complaint, he wrote them under the direction
of Valla. Indignantly repelling the charge of envy, he
remarked, that so notorious a fool as Valla, the object of
contempt to all the learned men of Italy, could not possibly
excite that passion. After noticing the imprudence of his
antagonist in provoking an inquiry into his own moral character,
he proceeded circumstantially to relate divers anecdotes,
which tended to fix upon Valla the complicated guilt
of forgery,<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> theft, ebriety, and every species of lewdness.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_447"></a>[447]</span>
Recurring to the charge of heresy, he referred to various
passages in Valla’s writings, which contained sentiments
contradictory to the orthodox faith. In fine, he arraigned
the supposed infidel before an imaginary tribunal, which
he represented as without mercy condemning him to the
infernal regions.</p>

<p>In reply to this second attack, Valla renewed and
maintained his protestation, that he had not been the
aggressor in the present contest. In contradiction to
Poggio’s assertion, that he was an object of dislike to the
scholars of Italy, he quoted several complimentary epistles
which he had on various occasions received from men
distinguished by their learning. He also exposed the
disingenuousness of his adversary, who had branded him
with the imputation of heresy, on the ground of certain
sentiments, which did indeed occur in his works, but
which he had advanced, not in his own character, but in
that of an Epicurean philosopher, whom he had introduced
as an interlocutor in a dialogue. As to the scandalous
stories which Poggio had related to the disparagement
of his good name, he solemnly asserted, that the greater
part of them had not the least foundation in truth, and
that the remainder were gross and wilful misrepresentations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_448"></a>[448]</span>
of facts;<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> and in the true spirit of retaliation, he narrated
concerning Poggio a number of anecdotes equally scandalous,
and in all probability equally false, as those of
the circulation of which he himself complained. On the
publication of this second part of the <i>Antidotus</i>, Poggio,
returning to the charge, annoyed his foe in a third invective,
in which, pursuing the idea of Valla’s having been
condemned to the infernal regions, he accounted for his
appearance on earth, by informing his readers, that on the
culprit’s arrival in hell, a council of demons was summoned
to decide upon his case; and that in consideration of the
essential wickedness of his character, they had permitted
him, after solemnly swearing allegiance to Satan, to return
to earth for the purpose of gratifying his malevolent dispositions,
by effecting the perdition of others.<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a></p>

<p>Before Valla had seen this narration of his transactions
in the kingdom of darkness, he was provoked, by the account
which he had received of its tenor, to prosecute his
criticisms on Poggio’s phraseology. These criticisms stimulated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_449"></a>[449]</span>
Poggio to renew hostilities in a fourth and a fifth
invective. The former of these compositions has not yet
been committed to the press. The latter abounds in those
flowers of eloquence, of which specimens perhaps more than
sufficiently ample have been already presented to the reader.</p>

<p>The heat of altercation between Poggio and Valla
was inflamed by the interference of Niccolo Perotti, a
pupil of the latter, who attacked Poggio with great virulence.
Poggio was not tardy in replying to this new
antagonist. If we may judge of the nature of his invective
against Perotti, by a short extract from it, which occurs in
Bandini’s catalogue of the manuscripts of the Laurentian
library, it was not at all inferior in acrimony to his other
compositions of a similar nature.<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> A friendly and sensible
letter of admonition, which Francesco Filelfo addressed to
the belligerent parties, exhorting them to consult for their
own dignity, by ceasing to persecute each other with
obloquy, is a memorable instance how much easier it is to
give wholesome advice than to set a good example.<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_450"></a>[450]</span></p>

<p>The foregoing traits of the history of literature prove,
that we must receive with some grains of allowance the
doctrine of the amiable Ovid, when he asserts that,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">—“Ingenuas didicisse fideliter artes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Emollit mores nec sinit esse feros.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is indeed a most lamentable truth, that few quarrels
are more violent or implacable than those which are excited
by the jealousy of literary rivalship, and that the bitterest
vituperative language on record occurs in the controversial
writings of distinguished scholars. Several causes concur<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_451"></a>[451]</span>
in producing this unhappy effect. It is of the very essence
of extraordinary talents to advance to extremes. In men
whose ardent minds glow with the temperature of genius,
whether the flame be kindled by the scintillation of love or
of enmity, it burns with impetuous fury. The existence of
many scholars, and the happiness of the great majority of
the cultivators of literature, depend upon the estimation in
which they are held by the public. Any assertion or insinuation,
therefore, derogatory to their talents or acquirements,
they consider as a dangerous infringement upon their dearest
interests, which the strong principle of self-preservation
urges them to resent. The objects upon which we employ
a considerable portion of our time and labour acquire in our
estimation an undue degree of importance. Hence it
happens, that too many scholars, imagining that all valuable
knowledge centers in some single subject of study to
which they have exclusively devoted their attention, indulge
the spirit of pride, and arrogantly claim from the public a
degree of deference, which is by no means due to the most
successful cultivator of any single department of science or
of literature. And in the literary, as well as in the commercial
world, undue demands are resentfully resisted; and
amongst scholars, as amongst men of the world, pride produces
discord. Learned men are also too frequently surrounded
by officious friends, whose ignorant enthusiasm of
attachment betrays them into a kind of idolatry, which is
productive of the most mischievous consequences to its
object. They who are accustomed to meet with a blind and
ready acquiescence in their opinions, in the obsequious
circle of their partizans, become impatient of contradiction,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_452"></a>[452]</span>
and give way to the impulse of anger, when any one presumes
to put their dogmas to the test of unreserved examination.
The flame of resentment is fanned by the foolish
partiality by which it was originally kindled; and the
noblest energies of some mighty mind are perverted to the
maintenance of strife, and the infliction of pain. The
operation of these causes produces many striking proofs,
that learning and wisdom are by no means identical, and
that the interpreter of the sublimest morals may become the
miserable victim of the meanest passions which rankle in
the human breast.</p>

<p>In the inaugural oration which Poggio addressed to
Nicolas V. he intimated, that it was his earnest desire to
dedicate his declining years to literary pursuits. This was
not a mere profession. Availing himself of the considerate
kindness of the heads of the Florentine republic, who, in
consideration of the respect due to his advanced age and to
his literary acquirements, excused him from any other task
than a general superintendence of the business of his office,
he continued to prosecute his studies with his accustomed
ardour.<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> The first fruits of his lucubrations after his final
settlement in the Tuscan capital appeared in a dialogue,
<i>De Miseriâ humanæ conditionis</i>, or, on the wretchedness
incident to humanity, which he dedicated to Sigismundo
Malatesta, Lord of Rimini, and commander in
chief of the Florentine forces. In this dialogue, Poggio
proposed to relate the substance of a conversation which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_453"></a>[453]</span>
took place between the accomplished Matteo Palmerio,<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a>
Cosmo de’ Medici, and himself, in consequence of the
serious reflections which occurred to some of Cosmo’s
guests, on the intelligence of the capture of Constantinople
by the Turks. Almost every species of distress which
awaits the sons of men passes in review in the course of
this work. Here the dark side of human life is industriously
displayed, and the serious lessons of humility and
self-discipline are inculcated in a feeling and forcible manner.
But even in this grave disquisition, Poggio could not
refrain from exercising his wonted severity upon the ascetics
and cœnobites, who had so often smarted under the merciless
lashes of his satire.<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a></p>

<p>This dialogue contains a record of the miserable end
of Angelotto, cardinal of St. Mark. This avaricious ecclesiastic
was murdered by one of his own domestics, who was
tempted to perpetrate this execrable deed by the hope of
plundering his master’s hoarded treasures. When the
assassin imagined that he had accomplished his purpose, he
left the chamber, where the cardinal lay weltering in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_454"></a>[454]</span>
blood, and called aloud for assistance. The relations and
servants of Angelotto immediately crowded into the apartment
accompanied by the murderer, who, affecting to be
overwhelmed with grief, took his station at the window.
He was, however, not a little startled on observing, that
in his trepidation he had not completely effected his wicked
intentions. The cardinal still breathed, and, though
unable to speak, he pointed to the assassin. The villain
endeavoured to divert the attention of the bye-standers
from the true meaning of this sign, by exclaiming, “See!
he intimates that the murderer came into the house
through this window.” This ingenious interpretation of
his dying master’s gestures did not, however, avert from
him the punishment due to his crime. He was arrested
and tried, and after having made a full confession of his
guilt, he expiated his offence by the forfeit of his life.<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></p>

<p>Soon after the publication of his dialogue <i>De Miseriâ
humanæ conditionis</i>, Poggio transmitted to Cosmo de’
Medici a version of Lucian’s <i>Ass</i>, on which he had bestowed
a few of his days of leisure. By the circulation of this
version he wished to establish a point of literary history,
which seems to have been till then unknown, namely, that
Apuleius was indebted to Lucian for the stamina of his
<i>Asinus Aureus</i>. It is a sufficient proof of the merit of
Poggio’s translation of Lucian’s romance, that Bourdaloue
has adopted it in his edition of the works of that entertaining
author.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_455"></a>[455]</span></p>

<p>The last literary production which exercised the talents
of Poggio was the History of Florence, a work for the composition
of which he was peculiarly well qualified, not only
by his skill in the Latin language, but also on account of
the means of information which were afforded to him by the
office which he held in the administration of the civil affairs
of the Florentine republic. This history, which is divided
into eight books, comprehends a most important and interesting
portion of the annals of Tuscan independence,
embracing the events in which the Florentines bore a share,
from the period of the first war which they waged with
Giovanni Visconti, in the year 1350, to the peace of
Naples, which took place in 1455. It has been justly
observed, that in his <i>Historia Florentina</i>, Poggio aims at
higher praise than that of a mere chronicler of facts, and
that he enlivens his narrative by the graces of oratory. In
imitation of the ancient historians, he frequently explains
the causes and the secret springs of actions, by the medium
of deliberative speeches, which he imputes to the principal
actors in the scenes which he describes. His statement of
facts is clear and precise; in the delineation of character,
which is an important and difficult part of the duty of the
historian, he evinces penetration of judgment and skill in
discrimination. Though the extent of territory to the
history of which his narration is confined be circumscribed
by very narrow limits, his work is by no means destitute
of the interest which arises from the description of protracted
sieges, bold achievements, and bloody encounters.
He has been accused of suffering his partiality to his native
country to betray him into occasional palliations of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_456"></a>[456]</span>
injustice of his fellow-citizens, and into false imputations
against their enemies. This accusation has been briefly
couched in the following epigram, written by the celebrated
Sannazaro.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Dum patriam laudat, damnat dum Poggius hostem,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nec malus est civis, nec bonus historicus.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It may, however, be remarked, that supposing this accusation
to be supported by unequivocal evidence, the advocate
of Poggio might plead in his excuse the general frailty of
human nature, which renders it almost impossible for a man
to divest himself of an overweening affection for the land of
his nativity. But it must be observed, that the impeachment
in question is founded upon a very few passages in the
History of Florence, and that it comes from a suspicious
quarter—from the citizens of those states, the political conduct
of which Poggio marks with disapprobation.</p>

<p>Poggio’s History of Florence was translated into
Italian by his son, Jacopo. This version, being committed
to the press, for a long space of time superseded the
original, which was confined to the precincts of the Medicean
library till the year 1715, at which period Giovanni
Battista Recanati, a noble Venetian, published it in a
splendid form, and enriched it with judicious notes, and
with a life of Poggio, the accuracy of which causes the
student of literary history to lament its brevity.<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_457"></a>[457]</span></p>

<p>The consideration of the great extent of the History of
Florence places in a striking point of view the industry and
courage of its author, who, in defiance of the infirmities of
old age, possessed the energy of mind to meditate, and the
diligence to execute, a work of such magnitude. Before,
however, it had received the last polish, the earthly labours
of Poggio were terminated by his death. This event occurred
on the 30th of October, 1459. On the second of
November ensuing his remains were interred with solemn
magnificence in the church of Santa Croce, in Florence.</p>

<p>The respect which the administrators of the Tuscan
government entertained for the virtues of Poggio, induced
them readily to comply with the pious wishes of his sons,<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_458"></a>[458]</span>
who requested permission to deposit his portrait, painted by
Antonio Pollaiuolo, in a public hall denominated the Proconsolo.
His fellow-citizens also testified their grateful
sense of the honour which his great accomplishments had
reflected on his country, by erecting a statue to his memory,
on the front of the church of Santa Maria del Fiore.<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a></p>

<p>It was with justice that the Florentines held the name
of Poggio in respectful remembrance. Inspired by a zealous
love of his country, he had constantly prided himself upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_459"></a>[459]</span>
the honour of being a citizen of a free state, and he
neglected no opportunity which presented itself of increasing
and displaying the glory of the Tuscan republic. And this
end he most effectually promoted by the splendour of his
own accomplishments. He so faithfully improved the
advantages which he enjoyed in the course of his education
in the Florentine university, that amongst the multitudes
of learned men who adorned his age, he occupied a station
of the highest eminence. His admission into the Roman
chancery, and his continuance in offices of confidence under
eight successive pontiffs, afford an ample proof not only of
his ability in business, but also of his fidelity and integrity.
Honoured by the favour of the great, he did not sacrifice
his independence at the shrine of power, but uniformly
maintained the ingenuous sentiments of freedom. The
whole tenor of his writings evinces, that he united to the
accomplishments of literature an intimate knowledge of the
world; and many passages might be quoted from his works
to prove that the eye of his mind surveyed a wider intellectual
horizon than fell to the general lot of the age in
which he lived. He was warm and enthusiastic in his
friendly attachments, and duteously eager to diffuse the
renown of those whom he loved. But acute sensations are
not productive of signal virtues alone; they too frequently
betray mankind into capital errors. Though Poggio was
by no means implacable in his anger, yet he was as energetic
in the expression of his resentment, as he was enthusiastic
in the language in which he testified his esteem for those to
whom he was bound by the ties of friendship. The licentiousness
in which he occasionally indulged in the early part<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_460"></a>[460]</span>
of his life, and the indecent levity which occurs in some of
his writings, are rather the vices of the times than of the
man. We accordingly find that those circumstances did not
deprive him of the countenance of the highest ecclesiastical
dignitaries—they did not cause him to forfeit the favour of
the pious Eugenius, or of the virtuous and accomplished
Nicolas V. His failings, indeed, were fully counterbalanced
by several moral qualities of superior excellence—by his
gratitude for benefits received; by his sincerity in friendship;
by his compassion for the unfortunate; and by his
readiness, to the extent of his ability, to succour the distressed.
To which it may be added, that he seems to have
recommended himself to most of those with whom he maintained
a personal intercourse, by the urbanity of his
manners, and by the sportiveness of his wit.</p>

<p>As a scholar Poggio is entitled to distinguished praise.
By a course of assiduous study, commenced at an early
period of his life and continued to its close, he became
intimately conversant with the works of the Roman classic
authors; and though he was somewhat advanced in age
when he began to direct his attention to Grecian literature,
by dint of methodic industry he made a considerable proficiency
in a knowledge of the writings of the Greek
philosophers and historians. From those enlightened preceptors
he imbibed those principles, which in his graver
treatises he applied with fidelity and skill to the investigation
of moral truth. To them, also, he was in no small degree
indebted for that noble spirit of independence, and for that
frankness of sentiment, which gave so much animation to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_461"></a>[461]</span>
his writings. The pictures of life and manners which he
exhibits in his works are sketched by the decisive hand of a
master, and are vividly coloured. His extensive erudition
supplied him with that abundance of apt illustration with
which his compositions are enriched. His Latin style is
singularly unequal. In the letters which he wrote in haste,
and which he addressed to his familiar friends, there occur
frequent specimens of a phraseology in which his native
idiom is thinly covered, as it were, with a transparent Roman
robe. But in his more elaborate compositions he manifested
the discernment of true taste, in selecting as his exemplar
the style of Cicero. His spirited endeavours to imitate this
exquisite model were far from being unsuccessful. His diction
is flowing, and his periods are all well balanced; but,
by the occasional admission of barbarous words and unauthorized
phraseology, as well as his evident want of an
intimate acquaintance with the philosophy of grammar, he
reminds his reader that at the time when he wrote, the Iron
age of literature was but lately terminated. His most striking
fault is diffuseness—a diffuseness which seems to arise,
not so much from the copiousness of his thoughts, as from
the difficulty which he experienced in clearly expressing his
ideas. It must, however, be observed, that he did not, like
many modern authors who are celebrated for their Latinity,
slavishly confine himself to the compilation of centos from
the works of the ancients. In the prosecution of his literary
labours he drew from his own stores; and those frequent
allusions to the customs and transactions of his own times,
which render his writings so interesting, must, at a period
when the Latin language was just rescued from the grossest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_462"></a>[462]</span>
barbarism, have rendered their composition peculiarly difficult.
When compared with the works of his immediate predecessors,
the writings of Poggio are truly astonishing. Rising
to a degree of elegance, to be sought for in vain in the rugged
Latinity of Petrarca and Coluccio Salutati, he prepared
the way for the correctness of Politiano, and of the other
eminent scholars, whose gratitude has reflected such splendid
lustre on the character of Lorenzo de’ Medici.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> Giovanni, the son of Jacopo Malpaghino, was born at Ravenna. In his
early youth he left his native city, and went to Venice, where he attended the
lectures of Donato Albasano, a celebrated grammarian. From the instructions
of Donato he derived considerable advantage; but his connexion with that
scholar was more eminently fortunate, as it introduced him to the acquaintance,
and procured him the friendship of Petrarca, who took him into his family, and
superintended the prosecution of his studies. In return for the kindness of his
accomplished patron, Giovanni undertook the improving employment of transcribing
his compositions—a task for which he was well qualified, as he had
added to his other acquirements that of a beautiful hand writing. Petrarca in
a letter to Giovanni Certaldo, which is preserved in Mehus’s life of Ambrogio
Traversari, mentions, with distinguished applause, the industry, temperance and
prudence of his young scribe; and particularly commends the tenaciousness of
his memory, in proof of which, he informs his correspondent, that Giovanni
had, in eleven successive days, qualified himself to repeat his twelve Bucolic
poems. Perhaps the highest eulogium that can be pronounced upon Giovanni is
this, that he continued to reside in the family of Petrarca for the space of fifteen
years, at the end of which time, by the death of that elegant enthusiast, he was
deprived of an enlightened master and a zealous friend. On this event he went
to Padua, where he for some time gained an honourable livelihood, by instructing
youth in the principles of eloquence. In the year 1397, he received an invitation
to undertake the office of public instructor, in the city of Florence.
This invitation he accepted, and discharged the duties of his station with great
applause, during the course of at least fifteen years. The time of his death is
uncertain. <i>Mehi Vita Ambrosii Traversarii, p. cccxlviii.-cccliii.</i>—<i>Ejusdem

<p><a id="Footnote_22" href="#FNanchor_22" class="label">[22]</a> The English reader will probably be surprised to recognize in Giovanni
Auguto, his countryman John Hawkewood. John was a soldier of fortune, and
had been engaged in the war which Edward III. king of England, carried on with
so much glory against France. On the conclusion of peace between those two
countries, he led into Italy a band of 3000 adventurers, of restless spirits, and
approved courage, who had engaged to fight under his banners, on behalf of
any state which would give them a suitable remuneration for their services. In
the year 1363, this army of desperadoes was hired by the republic of Pisa, and
spread ruin and devastation through the territories of Florence, with which state
the Pisans were then at war. They afterwards entered into the service of Bernabò
Visconti, lord of Milan, and being again opposed to the Florentines, they defeated
the Tuscan army, and made predatory incursions to the very gates of Florence.
Being defrauded by Bernabò of the remuneration which his services merited,
Hawkewood readily acceded to the terms proposed to him by the cardinal of
Berry, legate of pope Gregory XI. and heartily engaged on the side of the pontiff
in hostilities against the lord of Milan. Having assisted in the capture of nearly
a hundred towns belonging to that prince, he had the satisfaction of seeing him
reduced to the necessity of suing for peace. In the year 1375 he entered into the
service of the Florentines. In the course of a little time he was promoted to the
chief command of the Tuscan forces, in which capacity he merited and acquired
the confidence of his employers, by the courage and skill with which he conducted
the military operations of the Republic. He retained the office of Generalissimo
of the Florentine army till the time of his death, which event took place in the
latter end of the year 1393. The gratitude of the Florentines honoured him
with a magnificent funeral, and his fame was perpetuated by an equestrian
statue, erected to his memory at the public expense.</p>

<p>In a volume of portraits of illustrious men, engraven on wood, entitled Musæi
Joviani Imagines, and printed at Basil, An. 1577, there is a portrait of Auguto,
who is there denominated IOANNES AVCVTHVS. BRITAN. Underneath
this portrait is printed the following inscription.</p>

<p>Paulus Jovius, in his <i>Elogia Virorum illustrium</i>, <i>p. 105, 106</i>, gives a long
account of Auguto, who, he asserts, came into Italy in the suite of the duke
of Clarence, when that prince visited Milan, where he married the daughter of
Galeazzo Visconti.</p>

<p>Holingshed, in his Chronicle, has recorded the actions of Hawkewood in
the following terms. “And that valiant knight, Sir John Hawkewood, whose
fame in the parts of Italie shall remain for ever, where, as their histories make
mention, he grew to such estimation for his valiant achieved enterprises, that
happie might that prince or commonwealth accompt themselves that might
have his service; and so living there in such reputation, sometimes he served
the Pope, sometimes the Lords of Millane, now this prince or commonwealth,
now that, and otherwhiles none at all, but taking one towne or other, would
keep the same till some liking entertainment were offered, and then would he
sell such a towne, where he had thus remained, to them that would give him
for it according to his mind. Barnabe, Lord of Millane, gave unto him one
of his base daughters in marriage, with an honourable portion for her dower.</p>

<p>“This man was born in Essex, (as some write) who at the first became a tailor
in London, and afterwards going to the warres in France, served in the roome
of an archer; but at length he became a Capteine and leader of men of war,
highlie commended, and liked of amongst the souldiers, insomuch that when
by the peace concluded at Bretignie, in the yeare 1360, great numbers of soldiers
were discharged out of wages, they got themselves together in companies,
and without commandment of any prince, by whose authoritie they might
make warre, they fell to of themselves, and sore harried and spoiled diverse
countries in the realm of France, as partlie yee have heard, amongst whome
this Sir John Hawkewood was one of the principall capteines, and at length
went into Italie to serve the Marquis of Montserrato, against the Duke of
Millane, although I remember that some write how he came into that countrie
with the Duke of Clarence, but I thinke the former report to be true;
but it may well be that he was readie to attend the said Duke at his coming
into Italie.”—<i>Holingshed’s Chronicle, vol. ii. p. 413.</i></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_26" href="#FNanchor_26" class="label">[26]</a> Marignano was a castle, or country residence, to which Galeazzo had
retired to avoid the plague, which had made its appearance in Milan. Poggio
informs us in his history of Florence, that the day and hour of his departure from
his capital was fixed by his astrologers, whom he was accustomed to consult in
all cases of consequence. According to the observations of these soothsayers, so
evidently had the stars determined the proper season for his journey, and so
auspicious was the appearance of the heavens, that they boldly predicted that
their illustrious patron would return, graced with the title of King of Italy.
Poggio also asserts, that it was generally believed, that the death of Galeazzo
was portended by a comet, which appeared in the month of March preceding that
event. It should seem that the astrologers of the lord of Milan had forgotten
to take this comet into their calculations.</p>

<p>Poggio’s partiality to his native country did not render him blind to the
merits of Galeazzo, on whom he bestows the praise due to his liberality, magnanimity,
and noble manners. He also highly commends him for his patronage
of literature and of learned men. The following anecdote however, which is
recorded in Poggio’s Facetiæ, proves that the lustre of Galeazzo’s good qualities
was tarnished by his excessive indulgence in the pleasures of the table.</p>

<p>“Pope Martin V. had employed Antonio Lusco in the composition of some
letters, which, after he had perused them, the pontiff ordered him to submit to
the examination of a friend of mine, in whose judgment he had great confidence.
This person, who was a little disordered with wine at the time when
the letters were communicated to him, totally disapproved of them, and
ordered Lusco to re-write them. Then Antonio said to Bartolomeo de’ Bardi,
who happened to be present, I will do with my letters as the tailor did with
Giovanni Galeazzo’s waistcoat. Upon Bartolomeo’s asking what that was, he
replied, Giovanni Galeazzo was a very corpulent man, and was in the habit of
eating and drinking immoderately at supper. As he was retiring to rest after
one of these copious repasts, he sent for his tailor, and sharply reproved him
for making his waistcoat too tight, and ordered him to widen it. I will take
care said the tailor to execute your highness’s orders, and I trust that to-morrow
it will fit you to your satisfaction. He then took the garment in
question, and without making the least alteration in it, hung it on a nail.
Being asked why he did not make the waistcoat wider, according to the orders
which he had received, he said, to-morrow when the prince has digested his
supper, it will be found large enough. He accordingly carried it back in the
morning, when Galeazzo having put it on, said, Aye, now it will do—it fits
perfectly easy.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27" class="label">[27]</a> During the state of anarchy into which the Milanese territories fell, in
consequence of the folly and wickedness of the successor of Galeazzo, Como
and Piacenza became the prey of the soldiers, Vercelli and Novara were seized
by the marquis of Montferat. Pandolfo Malatesta made himself master of
Brescia; Ottobuono III. took possession of Piacenza, Parma, and Reggio.
Pavia, Alessandria, Tortona, and several other towns, submitted to the authority
of Facino Cane. This last chieftain was the captain of one of those bands
of adventurers, who at this time subsisted upon the wages which they received
for their military services, and upon the plunder of the rich towns and fertile
provinces of Italy. The following anecdote may serve to give the reader an
idea of the insolent rapacity with which these disciplined robbers carried on
their depredations.</p>

<p>“A person once complained to Facino Cane that he had been robbed of his
cloak by one of that captain’s soldiers. Facino, observing that the complainant
was clad in a good waistcoat, asked him whether he wore that at the
time when he was robbed. Being answered in the affirmative, Go, says he—the
man who robbed you cannot be one of my soldiers, for none of my followers
would have left you so good a waistcoat.”—<i>Poggii Hist. Flor.

<p><a id="Footnote_34" href="#FNanchor_34" class="label">[34]</a> Coluccio Salutati was born in the obscure town of Stignano, about the
year 1330. It appears from a letter which he wrote to Bernardo di Moglo, that
he was destitute of the advantages of early education, and that he did not apply
himself to the cultivation of polite literature, till he was arrived at man’s estate,
and that he then began his grammatical studies without the aid of a master.
When he deemed himself properly prepared to extend his literary career, he
went to Bologna, where he attended the public lectures of Giovanni di Moglo,
the father of the above-mentioned Bernardo. In compliance with the advice of
his relations and friends, he qualified himself for the profession of a notary;
but when he had acquired a sufficient knowledge of legal practice, he devoted
himself to the Muses, and composed several poems. In the forty-fifth year of
his age, he was elected chancellor of the city of Florence, which office he held
during the remainder of his life. He died on the fourth of May, 1406, and his
remains, after having been decorated with a crown of laurel, were interred with
extraordinary pomp, in the church of Santa Maria del Fiore. It was a subject
of great regret to Leonardo Aretino, that soon after his arrival in Rome, some
unfortunate misunderstanding deprived him of the affectionate regard of Coluccio,
and that the death of his veteran friend prevented him from effecting a
reconciliation, which he appears to have desired with all the earnestness of an
ingenuous mind.</p>

<p>Coluccio was the author of the following works, MS. copies of most of
which are preserved in the Laurentian library. 1 De Fato et Fortunâ. 2 De
sæculo et religione. 3 De nobilitate legum et medicinæ. 4 Tractatus de Tyranno.
5 Tractatus quod medici eloquentiæ studeant et de Verecundiâ an sit
virtus aut vitium. 6 De laboribus Herculis. 7 Historia de casu Hominis. 8 De
arte dictandi. 9 Certamen Fortunæ. 10 Declamationes. 11 Invectiva in Antonium
Luscum. 12 Phyllidis querimoniæ. 13 Eclogæ viii. 14 Carmina ad
Jacobum Allegrettum. 15 Sonnetti, and lastly, various Epistles, a collection
of which was published by Mehus in one volume, small quarto, printed at
Florence, A. D. 1741.</p>

<p>We may judge of the zeal which Coluccio manifested for the promotion of
literature by the extent of his library, which consisted of eight hundred volumes—a
magnificent collection in those early times, when good MSS. were very
scarce, and consequently very costly.—<i>Colluccii Vita à Philippo Villani, apud
Mehi editionem Epistolarum Lini Colucii Pierii Salutati</i>—<i>Leonardi Aretini

<p><a id="Footnote_36" href="#FNanchor_36" class="label">[36]</a> By gaining the victory in this contest, Leonardo considerably encreased
his reputation, as his competitor was a man of very respectable talents. Jacopo
d’Angelo was a native of Scarparia, and studied the Latin tongue under the
auspices of John of Ravenna. Understanding that Demetrius Cydonius and
Manuel Crysoloras had undertaken to give public lectures on the Grecian classics
in the city of Venice, he immediately repaired thither for the purpose of availing
himself of their instructions. So great was his zeal in the cause of literature,
that he accompanied Crysoloras to Constantinople, with a view of collecting
manuscripts, and attaining a more accurate and extensive acquaintance with
the Greek language. He translated into Latin Ptolomey’s Cosmographia, and
also Plutarch’s lives of Brutus and Pompey. His version of the Cosmographia
he dedicated to Alexander V. Contemporary scholars have given ample testimonies
to his literary abilities, but his studies were abruptly terminated by an
early death. <i>Mehi Vita Ambrosii Traversarii, p. xvi. ccclvi.</i>—<i>Ejusdem Vita

<p><a id="Footnote_43" href="#FNanchor_43" class="label">[43]</a> <i>Leonardi Aretini Epistolæ, l. ii. ep. xxi.</i> The cardinal of Bourdeaux,
conversing with Poggio on the tardiness of Gregory in fulfilling his engagement,
observed, that the conduct of his holiness reminded him of the wicked wit of
the humourist, who imposed upon the credulity of the populace of Bologna.
On Poggio’s asking him to what circumstance he alluded, he related the following
anecdote, which may bear a comparison with the story of the famous bottle-conjurer.
“There was lately at Bologna,” said the cardinal, “a wag, who
proclaimed by public advertisement, that on a certain day he would fly from
the top of a tower, situated about a mile from the city, near St. Raphael’s
bridge. On the day appointed, almost all the Bolognese assembled together;
and the man kept them waiting during the heat of the day, and until the
evening, all gazing at the tower, and expecting every moment that he would
begin his flight. At length he appeared on the top of the tower, and waved a
pair of wings, on which the multitude gave a shout of applause. The wag
however protracted the expected expedition till after sunset, when resolving
that the good people should not go home without seeing a sight, he deliberately
drew aside the skirts of his garment, and turned his posteriors to the
multitude, who immediately returned home, exhausted with fatigue and
hunger, and chagrined at their disappointment.” In my opinion, said the
cardinal, Gregory has practised upon the sacred college as complete a delusion,
as the wag practised upon the people of Bologna.—<i>Poggii Opera, p. 435.</i></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_47" href="#FNanchor_47" class="label">[47]</a> Leonardo Aretino, in his oration against Niccolo Niccoli, asserts, that
Niccolo’s grandfather was a tavern-keeper at Pistoia. “Avi autem tui caupona
Pistorii primum floruit non dignitate aliquà, sed fronde illâ festivâ quâ ad vinum
et popinas meretrices et ganeos invitabat. Inde nocturnâ ebriorum cæde conterritus
Pistorio demigravit, cauponam et serta Florentiam transtulit. Hic
tandem pater tuus cauponâ egressus vino abstinuit, oleo se ac lanificio perunxit,
sedens ad scamnum a matutino tempore quasi vile mancipium, sordido
ac prope miserabili exercitio defamatus. Profer igitur insignia nobilitatis
tuæ, qui alios tam insolenter contemnis. Habes enim præclarissima: ab avo
quidem frondes et cyathos; a patre vero lanam et pectines.”—<i>Mehi Vita
Ambrosii Traversarii, p. xxx.</i></p>

<p>So little regard did the learned men of the fifteenth century pay to truth in
their invectives, that the assertion of Leonardo Aretino is not sufficient evidence
of the history of Niccolo’s progenitors. But this is indisputably certain, that by
endeavouring to throw ridicule upon his former friend, by a reference to the
occupation of his ancestors, he only disgraces himself. The <i>frons festiva</i>, to
which he alludes in the passage quoted above, is the laurel, which it was then
customary to hang by way of a sign over the doors of taverns. From a similar
custom is derived our English proverb, “Good wine needs no bush.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_48" href="#FNanchor_48" class="label">[48]</a> <i>Mehi Vita Ambrosii Traversarii, p. lxxvi.</i> Lodovico Marsilio was an
ecclesiastic of the Augustine order, of which fraternity he became the superior
in the province of Pisa. His literary reputation caused him to be employed in
the chancery of the republic of Florence, and in the year 1382 he was appointed
of the number of the ambassadors sent by that state, to negociate a peace between
Carlo, the Hungarian prince, and the duke of Anjou. In so great estimation
was he held by the Florentines, that the administrators of their government
applied to Boniface IX., requesting his holiness to promote him to the dignity of
bishop of their city. The letter which was written on this occasion, and which
details his various merits in very flattering terms, is preserved by Mehus in his
life of Ambrogio Traversari. Lodovico carried on a correspondence with Coluccio
Salutati; and also with Petrarca, on a few of whose sonnets he wrote a
commentary. Several of his letters occur, but in a mutilated state, in a collection
of the epistles of the Tuscan Saints, published at Florence, in 4to. A. D.
1736. He died on the 21st of August, 1394.—<i>Mehi Vita Ambrosii

Niccolo Niccoli an interesting and elegant account of the remains of antiquity
which then existed in that city. Towards the close of his letter on this subject,
Leonardo dilates with great eloquence upon the praises of Carlo Malatesta.
After enlarging upon his merits as a soldier and a statesman, he thus proceeds.—“So
liberal has nature been in her gifts to him, that he seems to possess an universal
genius. He reads with the utmost grace—he writes verses—he dictates
the most elegant prose, and his hand-writing is so neat, that it is superior to
that of professed scribes. I should not have mentioned this fact, had I not
found the same circumstance recorded with respect to Augustus, and Titus
son of Vespasian.”—<i>Leonardi Aretini Ep., l. iii. ep. ix.</i></p>

Italian history, contains the following encomium on Alexander V.</p>

<p>“This pontiff, who truly deserved the name of Alexander, would have surpassed
in liberality all his predecessors, to the extent of a distant period, had
he not been embarrassed by the insufficiency of his revenues. But so great
was his poverty, after his accession to the papal chair, that he was accustomed
to say, that when he was a bishop he was rich, when he became a cardinal he
was poor, and when he was elected pontiff he was a beggar.”</p>

<p>A little while before his death he summoned the cardinals, who were then
attendant on his court, to his bed-side, and after earnestly exhorting them to
adopt such measures after his decease as were likely to secure the tranquillity of
the church, he took leave of them, by repeating the words of our Saviour,
“Peace I give you, my peace I leave unto you.”</p>

<p>In a manuscript volume, which formerly belonged to the house of Este,
there occurs the following epitaph on this pontiff, the two concluding lines of
which are so uncouth and obscure, that we may reasonably suspect some error
on the part of the transcriber.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_66" href="#FNanchor_66" class="label">[66]</a> Pietro Paulo Vegerio was a native of Capo d’Istria, a town situated at the
extremity of the Adriatic gulf, not far from Trieste. He was eminent for his
knowledge of the civil law, and made considerable proficiency in the study of
philosophy and the mathematics. Under the instruction of Manuel Crysoloras,
he also attained a respectable knowledge of the Grecian language. He composed
a treatise, <i>De moribus ingenuis</i>, which was received by the literary characters
of his time with considerable applause; and at the request of the emperor
Sigismund, he translated into Latin Arrian’s history of the expedition of
Alexander the Great. In the execution of this translation, he purposely avoided
the cultivation of elegance of style, through an apprehension, as he himself said,
lest his royal reader should stand in need of the assistance of an interpreter. He
testified his zeal for the honour of classical learning, by publishing an invective
against Carlo Malatesta, who, in detestation of heathens and heathenism, had
removed from the market place of Mantua, a statue of Virgil. In the latter period
of his life he lost his reason, which however returned at intervals before his
death, the date of which event is uncertain.—<i>Facius de Viris illustribus,

January 10, 1415. Aretino wrote from Constance a description of his journey
to that city, on the 29th of December, 1414. It is therefore evidently impossible
that he could have returned to Italy, and have there received letters from Poggio
within twelve days from that date. For 1415, we should certainly read 1416.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_71" href="#FNanchor_71" class="label">[71]</a> Leonardo Aretino, who does not appear to have possessed the slightest knowledge
of Hebrew, in a very curious letter to Giovanni Cirignano, entered into a
long train of argument, to prove the inutility of the study of that language.
Nothing is more disgusting, than the propensity of men of narrow minds to
undervalue those acquisitions in knowledge, to which they have not themselves
attained; and which they consequently have not the means of appreciating.

<p>This letter of Leonardo also shews the unhappy influence of religious bigotry
and sacerdotal tyranny, in checking the progress of science. The most cogent
argument which he advances, to prove the folly of spending time in the perusal
of the Hebrew scriptures, is this, that St. Jerome having translated the Old
Testament into Latin, whosoever presumes to study that book in the original,
manifests a distrust of the fidelity of Jerome’s version.—<i>Leonardi Aretini

that he wrote to him from Constance on the 19th of February, 1416; and in
another letter, addressed to Leonardo Aretino, he says, that the trial of Jerome
of Prague took place a few days after his return to the council. As Jerome’s
last hearing, to which Poggio evidently alludes, took place May 30th, 1416, the
date of Poggio’s journey to Baden is fixed between the above mentioned periods,
that is, in the spring of 1416.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_83" href="#FNanchor_83" class="label">[83]</a> Guarino Veronese, as his surname imports, was a native of Verona, in
which city he was born A. D. 1370. Dedicating himself to study from his early
years, he became a pupil of John of Ravenna. Not contented with acquiring,
under the instructions of this able tutor, a knowledge of the Latin language, he
undertook a voyage to Constantinople for the express purpose of reading the
Greek classics in the school of Manuel Crysoloras. Ponticio Virunio, who
flourished in the beginning of the 16th century, affirms, that when Guarino had
finished his Greek studies, he returned to Italy with two large chests full of
books, which he had collected during his residence in Constantinople; and that
he was so much affected by the loss of one of these valuable packages, which
perished in a shipwreck, that his hair became grey in the space of a single night.
But this story is generally considered as fabulous. On his return to his native
country, he adopted the profession of a public lecturer on Rhetoric, in which
capacity he visited various cities of Italy. The names of these cities are thus
enumerated by Janus Pannonius, who testified his gratitude for the benefit
which he had derived from Guarino’s instructions, by composing a poem to his
praise.</p>

of literary labour, in the year 1460, at the advanced age of ninety. Bartolomeo
Facio, who had been of the number of his pupils, made mention of him during
his lifetime in the following flattering terms.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_85" href="#FNanchor_85" class="label">[85]</a> Gasperino Barziza was a native of Bergamo, and was one of that numerous
assemblage of scholars, who were indebted for their knowledge of the Latin
tongue to John of Ravenna. He read lectures on Rhetoric, first at Padua, and
afterwards at Milan. His writings are not numerous: they consist of a treatise
on Orthography; another on Elegance of Composition; various Orations and
Letters; and a commentary on the Epistles of Seneca. In undertaking to
supply the deficiencies which occurred in Cicero’s treatise de Oratore, in consequence
of the mutilated condition of the ancient copies of that elegant and
useful work, he evinced a temerity of spirit which nothing but the most able
execution of his task could have justified. Happily however for the admirers
of ancient eloquence, the labours of Gasperino were rendered useless, by the
discovery of a complete copy of the work in question, made by the Bishop of
Lodi. It appears however that he had actually enlarged, by supplementary
chapters, the imperfect copies of <i>Quintilian’s Institutes</i>. These were also
superseded by the labours of Poggio in search of ancient manuscripts.</p>

<p>Several of Gasperino’s letters were edited by Josepho Alessandro Furietti,
and published at Rome, in 4to. A. D. 1733.—<i>Mehi Vita Ambros. Travers.,

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_86" href="#FNanchor_86" class="label">[86]</a> On the subject of matrimony, Francesco did not confine himself to
theoretical speculations. Trusting that in Maria, daughter of Piero Loredano,
procurator of St. Mark, he had found the union of good qualities which he had
represented in his dissertation, as requisite to the formation of the character of
a good wife, he married that lady in the year 1419.</p>

<p>So great was the reputation of his eloquence and prudence, that he had
scarcely attained the age of twenty-one, when notwithstanding the prohibition
of the Venetian law, he was admitted by the Concilio Maggiore into the number
of the senators. Three years after his exaltation to this honour, he was
appointed to the government of Como, which office, however, he did not
think proper to accept. It does not appear what were the motives which
induced him to decline this honour. His biographer Agostini attributes his
conduct in this instance to his modesty. If this amiable virtue, a quality of
such rare occurrence in the history of statesmen, prevented him from undertaking
the chief magistracy of the city of Como, it should seem that it did not
long continue to obstruct him in his way to preferment, since in the same year
in which he is supposed to have been thus diffident of his abilities, he suffered
himself to be invested with the government of Trivigi, in which city he presided
for the space of twelve months. The inhabitants of Trivigi lamented his departure,
and long entertained a respectful remembrance of the wisdom of his administration.
At the expiration of twenty-four years after the termination of his
government, they applied for his advice in the choice of a public preceptor; and
on this occasion, Francesco assured them, that he should always regard their
welfare as an object of his particular attention. Immediately after his return to
the Venetian capital, he was appointed, in conjunction with Leonardo Giustiniano,
to compliment the eastern emperor Palæologus on his arrival in Venice.
In the execution of this commission, he pronounced a Greek oration with such
elegance and purity of style and diction, that, as a contemporary writer affirms,
“He seemed to have been educated in the school of Homer.” Early in the
year 1424 he was nominated to the præfecture of Vicenza. On his accession
to this office, he found the laws of that city in such a state of confusion, that
he deemed it absolutely necessary to reduce them to order and consistency.
With the assistance of a committee of Vicentians, appointed for that purpose,
and of Antonio Lusco, a celebrated civilian, he happily accomplished this
difficult and delicate undertaking. Francesco was also the means of conferring
upon the citizens of Vicenza another public benefit, in inducing George of
Trebisond, whom he had invited from his native island Candia, to Italy, to
settle amongst them, in quality of professor of the Greek language. In the
year 1426 he was sent by the Venetian seignory to Rome, invested with the
office of embassador extraordinary at the pontifical court. The object of his
mission was to persuade Martin V. to enter into an alliance with his countrymen
against the duke of Milan, with whom the Venetians were then at war.
The pontiff, as became the common father of the faithful, interposed his good
offices between the contending powers; and after encountering a variety of
difficulties, he at length had the satisfaction of assembling a congress at Ferrara,
which terminated April 18th, 1428, in the signing of a definite treaty of peace
between the Venetians and their adversary. At this congress Francesco assisted
as one of the deputies of his republic.</p>

<p>In the course of the war, the Venetians had taken the city of Bergamo.
Of this newly acquired possession, Francesco Barbaro administered the government
in 1430. On the expiration of this office, he was raised to the dignity of
counsellor, and in the year 1433 he was elected by the Venetian government as
a member of the embassy of honour, which they deputed to attend the emperor
Sigismund, who purposed to travel through the states of the republic, on his way
to the city of Basil, where the general council was then assembled. On this
occasion, the Venetian envoys received from the emperor the honour of knighthood.
So great was the esteem which Sigismund had conceived of the good
qualities of Barbaro, that, with the permission of the seignory, he dispatched
him into Bohemia upon the difficult errand of soothing the irritation, and
abating the zeal of the confederated heretics. Nor was this the only instance of
the trust reposed in the fidelity of Francesco by foreign princes. On his return
from Germany he was employed by Eugenius IV. in conducting a negociation
with the emperor. His reputation being increased by these striking testimonies
to his merits, in the year 1434 he was appointed to the important and honourable
government of Verona. In this station he conducted himself with his
wonted wisdom, and consequently gained the esteem and affection of his
subjects. Soon after the expiration of the term of his new government, he was
dispatched to Florence, on an embassy to Eugenius IV. who then held his court
in that city. During this visit to Florence, the following circumstance took
place, which is related by Maffei as a proof of the patience and forbearance of
his temper. The steward of his household having been reproved by his nephew
Daniello Barbaro, was so much irritated, that he drew his sword, and attacked
the youth with an intention of killing him. Daniello complained of this outrage
to his uncle. Francesco sent for the offender, who vented his rage in the
most violent and indecent reproaches against his master. The by-standers
trembled for the life of the steward, when, to their astonishment, Francesco
thus addressed him. “Begone! and act more prudently in future; I would not
wish that your faults should make me lose that patience, of which, luckily
for you, I am now possessed.”</p>

<p>In the year 1437 Francesco was appointed governor of Brescia. In the
discharge of the duties of this office, he was obliged to call into exercise the full
vigour of his abilities. At the time of his appointment the Venetians were at
war with the duke of Milan, whose general, Piccinino, menaced their western
borders with a powerful army; and in the month of September encamped before
Brescia. On Francesco’s arrival in that city he had found it torn by faction,
and scantily supplied with provisions. But by his prudent exertions he
reconciled the contending families, and used the most strenuous exertions to
provide the place with the necessary supplies. Encouraged by his example,
the inhabitants repelled the attacks of the enemy with great valour, and patiently
endured the evils of famine and pestilence, consequent upon their being for the
space of three months closely confined within the walls of the town. At
length, in the month of December, they had the satisfaction of seeing the
Milanese forces retire. In gratitude for Francesco’s strenuous exertions in their
defence, the inhabitants of Brescia presented him with a banner ornamented
with the armorial bearings of their city; and when he returned to Venice, to
give the seignory an account of the events of his administration, the Brescian
deputies detailed his services to that august assembly in the most flattering
terms.</p>

<p>He was afterwards called to the discharge of various other public offices, in
which he acquitted himself in such a manner as to obtain universal commendation.
A most unequivocal testimony to his honour and intelligence occurred,
A. D. 1444, when he was chosen by the inhabitants of Verona and Vicenza as
umpire to settle a dispute which had arisen between those communities about
the limits of their respective territories. Having passed through all the inferior
offices of the state, on the 5th of January, 1452, he received what he regarded
as an ample reward of his labours, in being elected procurator of St. Mark.
Two years after his exaltation to this distinguished honour, his earthly career
of glory was terminated by his death, which event took place towards the end
of January, 1454.</p>

<p>His remains were interred in the church of Santa Maria Gloriosa, and the
following inscription marks the spot where his body is deposited.</p>

Miles gloriosus, Mercator, Pseudolus Pœnulus, Persa, Rudens, Stichus,
Trinummus, Truculentus—This volume was seized by cardinal Ursini, who
would not permit Poggio to take a copy of it. Poggio highly resented the
illiberality of the cardinal’s conduct. “I have not been able,” says he, addressing
himself to Niccolo Niccoli, “to get possession of Plautus. Before the
cardinal’s departure, I begged him to send you the book, but he refused to
comply with my request. I do not understand what the man means. He
seems to think that he has done something great, though in fact he has not had
the least participation in the discovery of the book. It was found by another,
but it is hidden by him. I told both him and his people, that I would never
again ask him for the book, and I shall be as good as my word. I had rather
unlearn what I have learnt, than acquire any knowledge by the means of his
books.” By the interposition of Lorenzo de’ Medici, however, the cardinal
was induced to intrust the volume to Niccolo Niccoli, who copied it, and
returned it to the Cardinal. Niccolo’s copy is deposited in the Marcian
library.—<i>Mehi Præfatio, p. xi-xliii.</i></p>

Aquæductis at Padua in the year 1722, procured a transcript of this manuscript,
which was still preserved in the monastery of Monte Cassino, and which he
found to be much more correct than any printed editions of Frontinus’s treatise.
It is in the form of a quarto volume, written on parchment, and, as appears
from a fac simile of the first ten or twelve lines, in a very legible character.
From the form of the letters, Polenus conjectures that it was written at the end

Poggio retained a considerable degree of indignation, which was at this time
excited in his mind, by the indifference with which his labours to recover the
lost writers of antiquity were regarded by the great. In the introduction to his
dialogue, <i>De Infelicitate Principum</i>, he puts the following strictures on their
conduct into the mouth of Niccolo Niccoli.—“When many of the ancient
classics had been brought to light by our friend Poggio, and there was a most
flattering prospect of the recovery of others of still greater consequence, no
sovereign prince or pontiff contributed in the least degree to the liberation of
those most excellent authors from the prisons of the barbarians. These
exalted personages spend their days and their money in pleasures, in unworthy
pursuits, in pestiferous and destructive wars. So great is their mental torpidity,
that nothing can rouse them to search after the works of excellent
writers, by whose wisdom and learning mankind are taught the way to true
felicity.”—<i>Poggii Opera, p. 394.</i></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_115" href="#FNanchor_115" class="label">[115]</a> Flavio Biondo, who was born at Forli, in the year 1388, was a descendant
of the illustrious family of Ravaldini. He has himself recorded the fact,
that he studied Grammar, Rhetoric, and Poetry, under the instructions of Giovanni
Ballistario, of Cremona. At an early age he was commissioned by his
countrymen to conduct some negociations at the court of Milan; and it was
during his visit to that city, that he executed the task of copying the newly-discovered
manuscript of Cicero’s treatise, <i>De Claris Oratoribus</i>. In the year
1430, he was making preparations for a journey to Rome; but Francesco Barbaro,
who held him in the highest esteem, and who had procured for him the privileges
of a Venetian citizen, having been lately appointed governor of the Bergamese
district, induced him to give up this design, and to accompany him to
Bergamo, invested with the confidential office of chancellor of that city. He
afterwards entered into the Roman chancery, under the patronage of Eugenius
IV., by whom he was employed in the year 1434, in conjunction with the bishop
of Recanati, to solicit, on his behalf, the assistance of the Florentines and Venetians.
He continued to hold the office of apostolic secretary during the pontificate
of Nicholas V., Calixtus III., and Pius II. In the year 1459 he attended
the last mentioned pontiff to the council of Mantua. From that city he
returned to Rome, where he died on the 4th of June, 1463, leaving five sons,
all well instructed in literature.</p>

<p>Of his numerous publications the following are the most considerable.</p>

<p>1. <i>Roma Instaurata</i>—A work of great erudition, in which he gave a most
exact description of the buildings, gates, temples, and other monuments of ancient
Rome, which still resisted the destructive hand of time.</p>

<p>2. <i>Roma Triumphans</i>—This is also a most elaborate treatise, which contains
an account of the laws, constitution, religion, and sacred ceremonies of the
Roman republic, collected from the incidental notices of these subjects, which
are scattered through the wide extent of Latin literature.</p>

<p>3. Of a similar description is his <i>Italia Illustrata</i>, in which he describes
Italy, according to its ancient division into fourteen regions, and details the
origin and history of each province and city. This work he composed at the
request of Alphonso, king of Naples.</p>

<p>4. A treatise, <i>De Origine et Gestis Venetorum</i>.</p>

<p>5. He undertook a work of still greater extent than any of those which have
been enumerated above, viz. A General History of the period extending from
the decline of the Roman Empire to his own times. He had finished three decads
and the first book of the fourth of this work, when its prosecution was interrupted
by his death.</p>

<p>“In all these works,” says Tiraboschi, “though Biondo occasionally deviates
into various errors, he displays a singular diligence in collecting from all
authors whatever appertains to his subject; and when it is considered, that
they are the first essays in their kind, they cannot but give the reader a high
idea of the prodigious learning and unwearied application of their author.”</p>

<p>The historical works of Biondo, translated into Italian by Lucio Fauno,
were printed at Venice by Michel Tramezzino. A general collection of his
writings was also printed in folio, at Basil, by Frobenius, A. D. 1531 and 1539.

we suppose, that the reverend ecclesiastic was so little acquainted with the
private history of the Florentine gentry, as to be ignorant of the intercourse
which subsisted between Benvenuta and his friend—or shall we conclude that
he did not regard this intercourse as a breach of moral duty?—<i>Ambrogii

exist there. The catalogue of that valuable repository of learning does indeed
make mention of a MS. volume, as containing the oration in question. On an
accurate examination of this volume, however, no trace was found of Leonardo’s
Invective, nor any appearances to justify the suspicion, that this or any other
work has been withdrawn from it by the rapacity of literary peculation.</p>

<p>These were the sentiments of Poggio, in the season of serious meditation.
On another occasion, when irritated by the sarcasms of Cardinal Julian, he
ascribed his abjuration of the priesthood to a somewhat different motive. “Nolo
esse Sacerdos, nolo Beneficia; vidi enim plurimos, quos bonos viros censebam,
maxime autem liberales, post susceptum sacerdotium avoras esse et
nulli deditos virtuti, sed inertiæ, otio, voluptati. Quod ne mihi quoque
accidat veritus, decrevi procul a vestro ordine consummere hoc, quidquid
superest, temporis perigrinationis meæ; ex hâc enim magnâ capitis Sacerdotum

<p><a id="Footnote_132" href="#FNanchor_132" class="label">[132]</a> <i>Muratori Annali, tom. ix. p. 93.</i> Baldassare Cossa is generally distinguished
by the pontifical appellation of John XXIII. He was however in fact
only the twenty-second of that name who filled the papal chair. The mistake
in his designation arises from the extraordinary circumstance of the annalists
of the holy see having admitted into the series of pontiffs the famous pope
Joan, who it is asserted, on succeeding Leo IV. in the pontificate, assumed the
name of John VII. This ecclesiastical Amazon is said to have been an Englishwoman,
who went in man’s attire with her lover to Athens, where she made
such a proficiency in her studies, that she rose through the subordinate degrees
of clerical preferment to the supreme honours of the pontificate. It is further
alleged, that having become pregnant by one of her domestics, she was seized
with the pains of labour, as she was conducting a procession to the church of
St. John Lateran, and expired in the street. This improbable story is related
by Platina, who observes, however, that though it is commonly believed, it rests
upon doubtful authority. He informs us, that those who maintain the truth of
this narration, allege in proof of its authenticity, two circumstances, namely,
that the pontiffs always avoid passing through the street where this untoward
accident is said to have happened: and that on the installation of a newly
elected pope, he is obliged to undergo a ceremony, which would infallibly detect
any attempt at a repetition of the above-mentioned imposture. With regard to
the first of these allegations, Platina acknowledges the fact of the pontiff’s avoiding
the supposed scene of Joan’s disgrace; but says, that the reason of this is,
that the street in question is too narrow to admit the passage of a crowded retinue.
With regard to the second, he makes the following truly curious remark. “De

<p>In the annotations subjoined by Panvinio to the Italian translation of
Platina’s history, published at Venice, A. D. 1744, it is most satisfactorily
proved, that this story of John VII., alias pope Joan, is a gross falsehood,
invented by one Martin, a monk.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_142" href="#FNanchor_142" class="label">[142]</a> Of this great personage Poggio has recorded an anecdote, which at once commemorates
her reputation for gallantry, and her ready wit. “The Florentines,”
says he, “once sent a certain doctor of laws of the name of Francesco as their
embassador to the court of Naples. Francesco being apprised of the amorous
disposition of the reigning queen Joanna, requested on his second interview
with her majesty, that she would grant him a private audience, as he was instructed
by his republic to communicate certain matters to her majesty alone.
The queen accordingly withdrew with him into an inner apartment, where
after a short preliminary conversation, he abruptly made to her a declaration
of love; on which Joanna looked upon him with a pleasant smile, and said,
<i>Was this also in your instructions?</i>”—<i>Poggii Opera, p. 448.</i></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_143" href="#FNanchor_143" class="label">[143]</a> Whilst Louis II., on whose claim that of Louis III. was founded, was on
his march from Provence to the Neapolitan frontier, he was visited in his camp
by Rodolfo of Camerino, to whom he made an ostentatious display of a valuable
assortment of jewels, which he destined as ornaments of the regal state, which
he flattered himself he should shortly attain. Rodolfo, unmoved by the brilliant
spectacle, asked him what was the value and use of this collection. Louis
answered, that it was very valuable, but of no utility. “I can show you at my
house,” replied Rodolfo, “a pair of stones which cost only ten florins, and
annually produce me a revenue of two hundred.” The duke was astonished
at this assertion; but Rodolfo soon solved the riddle, by shewing him a mill
which he had lately erected, intimating at the same time, that a wise man will
always prefer utility to finery.—<i>Poggii Opera, p. 440.</i></p>

<p>Rodolfo was indeed a man of very phlegmatic humour, as appears by the
advice which he gave to one of his fellow-citizens, who informed him of his
intention of travelling with a view of seeing the curiosities of different countries.
“Go,” said he, “to the neighbouring town of Macerata, and there you will see
hills, valleys, and plains, wood and water, lands cultivated and uncultivated.
This is the world in miniature; for travel as far as you please, and you will
see nothing else.”—<i>Poggii Opera, p. 441.</i></p>

instance, which occurred during the course of this contest, of the freedom
of speech in which Filippo Maria permitted one of his domestics to indulge
himself.</p>

<p>“The old duke of Milan, a prince in all respects of singular good taste,
had an excellent cook, whom he had sent to France to learn the art of dressing
nice dishes. In the great war which he carried on against the Florentines, he
one day received some bad news, which gave him a good deal of uneasiness.
Soon after the arrival of this intelligence he sat down to dinner. The dishes
not at all pleasing him, he sent for his cook, and reproved him severely for
his unskilfulness. The cook, who was accustomed to take great liberties with
his master, replied, I can assure your highness that the dishes are excellently
dressed—And if the Florentines have taken away your appetite, how am I to
blame?”—<i>Poggii Opera, p. 425.</i></p>

<p>This anecdote proves that Filippo inherited from his father a fondness of
good living, and also intimates, that even at this early period, our Gallic neighbours
were noted for their skill in cookery.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_153" href="#FNanchor_153" class="label">[153]</a> It should seem that Humphrey, duke of Gloucester, who at this time
governed the kingdom of England in quality of Protector, regarded this commission
of the cardinal’s with a jealous eye. With a view of preventing the
mischiefs which might ensue upon the exercise of foreign authority in the
English dominions, he summoned Beaufort into his presence; and by a formal
and express act, which set forth, that the legates of the pope had never been
permitted to enter into England, except by summons, invitation, or permission
of the king, which summons, invitation, or permission, Beaufort had not
received, protested against his exercising the authority of legate in the king’s
dominions in any form or manner whatever. To this protest Beaufort put
in a formal answer, that it was not his intention in any thing to derogate from,
or contravene the rights, privileges, liberties, or customs of the king or kingdom.
This protest was made November 11th, 1428. It is printed in the
appendix to Brown’s <i>Fasciculus Rerum expetendarum et Fugiendarum</i>, <i>p.
618</i>, from an ancient register, formerly in the possession of archbishop Sancroft.</p>

<p>For the purpose of raising money to defray the expense of the crusade, boxes
emblazoned with the sign of the cross were fixed in the churches, in which the
friends of the true faith were exhorted to deposit their contributions. To give
additional stimulus to the zeal of the pious, the pontiff issued a bull, whereby
he granted an indulgence of one hundred days to those who should attend the
preaching of the crusade—a full pardon of all their sins, and an assurance of
eternal happiness, to those who took the cross and served against the heretics at
their own expense. The same premium was offered to those, who fully intending
to perform this meritorious service, should happen to die before they joined
the army; and to those who should send a soldier or soldiers to fight, at their
expense, for the propagation of the true faith. This latter provision was particularly
addressed to the women, who were graciously informed by the cardinal, that
those females, who, being prevented by their poverty from maintaining each a
warrior at their own expense, should enter into joint subscriptions for the purpose,
should be entitled to considerable privileges; and so grateful was his
holiness even for the gift of good wishes, that he granted six days’ indulgence
to those who fasted and prayed in order to promote the success of the
expedition.—<i>Appendix to Brown’s Fasciculus, p. 621, 625, 630.</i></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_160" href="#FNanchor_160" class="label">[160]</a> This Bernardino had for some time preached with uncommon applause to
crowded audiences in the churches of Florence. The talents of a popular orator
generally procure their possessor as many enemies as friends. Several ecclesiastics,
who were envious of the reputation of Bernardino, took advantage of
a daring flight of rhetoric, into which he was betrayed by the enthusiasm of his
zeal, to endeavour to accomplish his ruin. In order to enforce his eloquence, in
describing some impressive scene, (probably the sufferings of Christ) he exhibited
to the people a picture, in which the transaction to which he alluded was
delineated. Of this exhibition his detractors complained to the pope, as a kind
of profanation of the rites of the church; and Bernardino was obliged to repair
to Rome to vindicate his cause. Though the pontifical court was inflamed with
prejudice against him by the artifices of his accusers, so captivating was his
eloquence, that when he was permitted to preach in Rome, the ecclesiastics of
the highest eminence, as well as the populace, being attracted by his fame to
hear his discourses, listened to him with enthusiastic admiration. Martin V.
commanded him to abstain for the future from the exhibition of pictures; he
readily complied with this injunction, and by his prompt obedience obtained the
favour of the pontiff, who during the remainder of his life treated him with
distinguished kindness.—<i>Ambrosii Traversarii Epist. lib. ii.

<p><a id="Footnote_162" href="#FNanchor_162" class="label">[162]</a> In the original sketch of this dialogue, Poggio had attributed the first
part of the attack on Avarice to Cincio, one of the apostolic secretaries; but on
the admonition of Lusco, that as Cincio had the reputation of being a covetous
man, an invective against that vice would be out of character, if represented as
proceeding from him, he substituted in his place Bartolomeo di Montepulciano.
The defence of Avarice he assigned to Lusco, because Lusco being generous
even to extravagance, there was no reason to fear, lest the imputed patronage of
so selfish a passion, should be supposed to convey an implied impeachment of
his character.—<i>Ambrosii Traversarii Opera, tom. ii.

Poggio has recorded a notable story of one of these indiscreet orators, who in
the fervour of a declamation against the vice of adultery, declared, that he had
such a detestation of that offence, that he had much rather commit the sin of
unchastity with ten virgins than with one married woman.—<i>Poggii Opera,

in his <i>Facetiæ</i> a mortifying explanation which one of these noisy
orators provoked by his overweening vanity. “A monk,” says he, “preaching
to the populace, made a most enormous and uncouth noise, by which a good
woman, one of his auditors, was so much affected, that she burst into a
flood of tears. The preacher, attributing her grief to remorse of conscience,
excited within her by his eloquence, sent for her, and asked her why she was
so piteously affected by his discourse. Holy father, answered the mourner, I
am a poor widow, and was accustomed to maintain myself by the labour of
an ass, which was left me by my late husband. But alas! my poor beast is
dead, and your preaching brought his braying so strongly to my recollection,
that I could not restrain my grief.”—<i>Poggii Opera, p. 497.</i></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_165" href="#FNanchor_165" class="label">[165]</a> Alberto derived the designation of Da Sarteano from a small town in
Tuscany, where he was born, A. D. 1385. At an early age he enrolled himself
in the number of the conventuals, and afterwards joined the stricter order of
the <i>Fratres Observantiæ</i>. In the year 1424 he went to Verona, where he
studied the Greek language under the instruction of Guarino Veronese. In the
following year he paid a visit to Francesco Barbaro, who was then governor of
Trivigi. Here he met with the famous preacher Bernardino, at whose instance
he undertook the popular employment of an itinerant preacher. In this capacity
he not only traversed a great part of Italy, but crossing the sea, he went to
preach the true gospel amongst the schismatics and infidels of Greece, Egypt,
Ethiopia, and Armenia. It was in consequence of his representations that the
patriarch of the last-mentioned province attended the council of Basil, when in
the name of his countrymen he submitted to the decisions of the Latin church.
Alberto closed a life of religious labours in the year 1450, at Milan, where he
was interred in the church of St. Angelo. A collection of his works, consisting
principally of sermons and theological tracts, was published at Rome,
A. D. 1688.—<i>Tiraboschi Storia della Letter. Ital. tom. vi.

Orthuinus Gratius, of Deventer, was republished, with considerable additions,
by Edward Brown, at London, A. D. 1689, at which period the avowed predilection

zealous Protestants of England.</p>

was hired to commit so execrable a deed, but intimates very strong suspicions
of Cosmo de’ Medici. Poggio, however, in his third invective against Filelfo,

<p>In a letter of remonstrance to Cosmo de’ Medici, Filelfo inveighed bitterly
against Niccolo Niccoli, whom he asserted Cosmo had himself acknowledged
to be guilty of insolence to the learned, and particularly of contumelious conduct
towards the eminent Manuel Crysoloras.—“Ad ea tu sane leniter respondisti,
ac subridens, non oportere inquiens mirari me nec æge ferre Nicolai
Nicoli detractionem; eo enim esse hominem ingenio ut neminem doctum
virum relinquat intactum mordacitate suà, quique ne soli quidem ipsi parceret,
<i>upote qui et Manuelem Chrysoloram sapientem et summum illum
virum barbam pediculosam adhuc semper nominet</i>, et Ambrosium monachum
cui magis affectus est quam propriæ animæ, attonitum per contumeliam
vocet.”—<i>Philelfi Epistolæ, p. 12.</i></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_242" href="#FNanchor_242" class="label">[242]</a> The decree relative to the conversion of the Jews ordained amongst
other things, that all diocesans should annually commission certain learned
theologians to explain to them the word of God, in so plain a manner, that
they might be convinced of their errors—that the Jews should be compelled, by
the infliction of certain penalties, to attend the lectures of these theologians—that
all infidels should be prohibited from keeping Christian servants or nurses—that
no Christian should partake of any Jewish festivals—that the Jewish tradesmen
should be strictly forbidden to buy, or take in pawn, any ecclesiastical books,
chalices, crosses, or other church ornaments—that the Jews should be compelled
to wear a distinguishing dress, and that they should live in a separate quarter of
each town, at as great a distance as possible from any church. With regard to
the converted Israelites, it was ordained, that whereas whatever goods or property
they had obtained by usury, or by defrauding persons who were not to be
found, became upon this conversion the property of the church; the council, in
the name of the church, bestowed upon them all such property as a baptismal
present—that the indigent converts should be relieved by the charitable assistance
of the faithful—that they should be separated as much as possible from their
unbelieving brethren—and that the ordinaries of each diocese should be directed
to do all in their power to cause them to marry persons who had been born in
the Christian faith.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_247" href="#FNanchor_247" class="label">[247]</a> On the 15th of October, 1435, the council condemned as heretical various
propositions which had been lately maintained by Agostino di Roma, archbishop
of Nazareth, in three elaborate theological tracts. Those whose anxiety
to preserve the purity of the catholic faith leads them to wish to know what
sentiments it is their duty to reject, and those who are interested in observing
the niceties of theological distinctions, will perhaps be gratified by the following
recital of the dangerous errors which incurred the severe reprehension and reprobation
of the venerable synod of Basil.</p>

<p>“Et postissime scandalosam illam assertionem, erroneam in fide, in ipso
libello contentam, quam piæ fidelium aures sine horrore audire non possunt,
videlicet: Christus quotidie peccat; ex quo fuit Christus quotidie peccavit;
quamvis de capite ecclesiæ Christo Jesu Salvatore nostro dicat se non intelligere,
sed ad membra sua, quæ cum Christo capite unum esse Christum
asseruit, intelligentiam ejus esse referendam dicat. Nec non et propositiones
istas, et eis in sententiâ similes, quas in articulos damnatos in sacro Constantiensi
Concilio incidere declarat, videlicet: Non omnes fideles justificati sunt
membra Christi, sed soli electi, finaliter in perpetuum regnaturi cum Christo.
Secundum ineffabilem præscientiam Dei sumuntur membra Christi, ex quibus
constat ecclesia, quæ tamen non constat nisi ex eis qui secundum propositum
electionis vocati sunt. Non sufficit Christo uniri vinculo caritatis, ut aliqui
efficiantur membra Christi, sed requiritur alia unio. Has etiam quæ sequuntur:
Humana natura in Christo, vere est Christus. Humana natura in
Christo, est persona Christi. Ratio suppositalis determinans humanam naturam
in Christo non realiter distinguitur ab ispâ naturâ determinatâ. Natura
humana in Christo procul dubio est persona verbi; et verbum in Christo
naturâ assumpta, est realiter persona assumens. Natura humana assumpta a
verbo ex unione personali, est veraciter Deus naturalis et proprius. Christus
secundum voluntatem creatam tantum diligit naturam humanam unitam
personæ verbi, quantum diligit naturam divinam. Sicut duæ personæ in
divinis sunt æqualiter diligibiles ita duæ naturæ in Christo, humana et
divina, sunt æqualiter diligibiles propter personam communem. Anima
Christi videt Deum tam clare et intense, quantum clare et intense Deus videt
seipsum. Quas quidem propositiones, et alias ex eâdem radice procedentes,
in prædicto libello contentas, tamquam erroneas in fide, damnat et reprobat
hæc sancta Synodus.”—<i>Concil. tom. xxx. p. 172.</i></p>

Francesco’s conduct, addressed to Andreolo Giustiniano, it should seem, either
that the busts did not answer the expectation which he had formed concerning
the exquisiteness of their workmanship, or that he suspected that Francesco
had substituted inferior pieces of sculpture, in the place of those destined for
him by Suffretus. The following is the expression in question. “Cum Suffretus
quidem Rhodius ei consignasset tria capita marmorea, et signum integrum
duorum fere cubitorum, quæ Franciscus se ad me allaturum promisit,
<i>capita quædam dedit</i>, signo autem me fraudavit,” &amp;c. Perhaps, however,
quædam is, by an error of the press, substituted for quidem.</p>

of Manuscripts which are stored up in a few public libraries on the continent of
Europe. In the year 1802, the author of this work was fortunate enough to find
in the then <i>Bibliothéque Nationale</i>, now <i>Bibliothéque du Roi</i>, at Paris, a very
legible manuscript copy of it, which he carefully transcribed; and soon after
his return home he printed a very small impression of it for distribution among
his literary friends. A copy of this impression having been sent by him to the
late Dr. Parr, that eminent scholar urged him to reprint and publish it, with a
few necessary corrections. The wish of Parr was complied with, and the
Dialogue was brought out in the year 1807, with a Latin preface and a Latin
dedication to the late Mr. Roscoe. In the year 1823, the Signor Pecchioli
published at Florence a new edition of it, which is enriched with various
readings from a MS. in the Riccardi library.</p>

not only parted with his mistress, but also deprived four of his illegitimate
children, who were then living, of an inheritance which he had secured to them
by a Bull of legitimacy. This statement, however, rests only on the authority
of Valla, the bitter personal enemy of Poggio, and it has been satisfactorily
proved by the Cavaliere Tonelli (<i>Ton. Tr. vol. i. p. 266.</i>) that this imputation
is of the number of those calumnies in which the scholars of the fifteenth
century were, in their contests with each other, so apt to indulge.</p>

posterity, and though from the designation of “Franciscum quendam Ferrariensem,”
by which he is mentioned in a letter from Poggio to Niccolo Niccoli, it
should seem that he was not much known, even to his contemporaries, the circumstance
of Poggio’s inscribing to him a volume of his compositions affords
reasonable grounds for a supposition that he was a man of learning, and of a
respectable character. This supposition is confirmed by the respectful manner in
which Poggio, in the following letter, thanks him for the offer of his friendship,
and the assurance of his esteem.</p>

<p>“I have long maintained a most pleasant intercourse with my friend Scipio,
of Ferrara, a man, whose learning and liberal manners lay an irresistible
claim to my esteem and love. We often spend our leisure time in conversing
together on various subjects, and particularly on the characters of learned
and eloquent men. Of this number he assures me that you are one. He
informs me, that you are not only devoted to literature, which circumstance
is of itself a great recommendation, but, what is of the greatest weight,
that your manners are most amiable, and that you are endowed with the
most attractive virtues. He moreover says, that you are very much attached
to me. This is a piece of intelligence which, I must confess, affords me the
sincerest pleasure; for there is nothing, my dear Francesco, which I
have more at heart, than to gain the esteem and good will of my fellow
mortals. You are sensible that he who is favoured with the affection of his
acquaintance, especially of those who are dignified by their virtues, is truly
rich, and possesses a source of sincere enjoyment. I therefore most heartily
embrace your proffered friendship, from which I trust I shall derive both
pleasure and honour. Be assured of this, that I shall do my utmost endeavour
to confirm, by my conduct, those friendly sentiments which you have
voluntarily conceived on my behalf.—Farewell.”—<i>Poggii Opera, p. 307.</i></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_309" href="#FNanchor_309" class="label">[309]</a> <i>Ibid, p. 353, 354, 355.</i> Two manuscript copies of this work are preserved
in the Laurentian, and a third in the Magliabecchian library at Florence. A
fourth is deposited in the Ambrogian collection at Milan. The disgusting
ribaldry of Beccatelli fully justifies the reproof which he received from Poggio.
It is a disgrace to literature, that his work should have been lately committed
to the press under the superintendence of a French editor.</p>

<p>The Hermaphroditus was openly condemned, not only by Poggio, but also
by Filelfo, Laurentius Valla, and by Mariano da Volterra, who inveighed against
it in a long poem. It was the subject of reprobation in the sermons of Bernadino
da Siena, and of Roberto da Lecce, who caused it to be burnt in the public
squares of Bologna and Milan. The zeal of Valla, (which, by the way, was
kindled as much by personal enmity as by a regard to morality) prompted him

proverbial sarcasm to their neighbours. “Bartolomeo Soccini, of Siena,” says
Mr. Roscoe, in his life of Lorenzo de’ Medici, “having observed, in allusion to
the defect in Lorenzo’s sight, that the air of Florence was injurious to the
eyes—<i>true</i>, said Lorenzo, <i>and that of Siena to the brain</i>.” When Leo X.
was elected to the pontificate, the Roman wits thus interpreted a certain date of
the year <span class="allsmcap">MCCCCXL</span>, which was inscribed on a tablet in the church of the Vatican:

<p><a id="Footnote_355" href="#FNanchor_355" class="label">[355]</a> The following analysis of Gianozzo’s oration will be sufficient to prove,
that the foregoing censure is by no means too severe.—He began his address by
informing his auditors, that if the immortal Muses (“immortales Musæ divinæquo
Camœnæ”) could have deemed it compatible with their dignity to make
an oration, either in the Latin or the Greek language, or to weep in public,
they would not have delegated to another the task of paying the last honours to
Leonardo; but since this exhibition of their grief was contrary to the usual
habits of the Nine, the administrators of the Tuscan government had determined
that the virtues of the deceased should be celebrated by one of his colleagues.
He then with due modesty declared, that their choice having been directed to
himself, not on account of his talents, but in consequence of his filling one of
the principal offices of the state, he had prepared himself for the occasion, not
to his own satisfaction, but as well as the brevity of the time allowed him for
the purpose would permit.—The orator then proceeded to give a sketch of the
life of Leonardo. When he arrived at that period of it in which the deceased
became one of the public functionaries of the state, he detailed at some length
the history of the Florentine republic during the time of Leonardo’s possession
of civic and military offices. In the course of his minute detail of Leonardo’s
literary labours, he contrived to introduce brief notices of a considerable number
of Greek and Latin writers, and enlarged particularly upon the merits of Livy
and Cicero, to each of whom he represented Leonardo as superior, since he not
only translated Greek authors into Latin, after the example of the latter, but also
wrote histories, in emulation of the former, thus uniting the excellencies of
both. After this, preparing to perform the ceremony of coronation, he proved
by historical evidence, that the custom of crowning emperors and poets was very
ancient. Descanting on the various kinds of military crowns, he informed his
auditors, that by the frequent perusal of ancient writers, he had ascertained,
that of these tokens of honour there were eight different species, namely, the
Corona Obsidionalis, Civica, Muralis, Castrensis, Navalis, Ovalis, quasi Triumphalis,
and Triumphalis. The description of the materials of which these
crowns were severally made, the occasions on which they were bestowed, the
enumeration of divers eminent commanders whose brows they had adorned, led
the errant orator into a further digression, from which he did not return before
he had detailed at great length the reasons why poets should be crowned with
laurel, in preference to ivy, palm, olive, or any other species of evergreen.
This dissertation on crowns occupies the space of five quarto pages, closely
printed in a small type. Having exhausted this topic, Gianozzo proceeded to
prove, that Leonardo was a poet. This led him to enumerate most of the Greek
and Latin poets, and to explain the derivation of the term <i>poeta</i>. In treating
on this subject, he announces the marvellous discovery, that he who wishes to
be a poet, must write excellent poems! “Itaque si quis poeta esse cuperet
quædam egregia poemata scribat oportet.” Having endeavoured by sundry
truly original arguments to vindicate Leonardo’s claim to the poetic wreath, he
closed his harangue by the performance of the prescribed ceremony.</p>

as have been committed to the press, is extracted from the enumeration of his

<p><a id="Footnote_382" href="#FNanchor_382" class="label">[382]</a> Poggio’s narrative of the discoveries made by Niccolo Conti was translated
into the Portuguese language, by the command of Emanuel I. king of Portugal.
From the Portuguese version, an Italian translation was made by Giambattista
Ramusio, who inserted it in the first volume of his collection of voyages and
travels, printed in folio at Venice, in the year 1588. A small portion of the
first book of the dialogue <i>De Varietate Fortunæ</i> containing the description of
the ruins of Rome, is printed in the Basil edition of the works of Poggio. A
manuscript copy of the entire dialogue was discovered in the library of the
cardinal Pietro Ottoboni, nephew of pope Alexander VIII., by Lionardo Adami
da Bolsena, who began to prepare it for the press. Lionardo having died before
he had finished the transcript of the first book, the execution of his design was
completed by the Abate Domenico Giorgi da Rovigo, who finished the transcript
of the dialogue, illustrated it with notes, and subjoined to it fifty-seven of
Poggio’s epistles, which had not yet seen the light. Under the superintendence
of the Abate Oliva, the work thus prepared was printed at Paris, in 4to., an.
1723, by Coustellier.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_389" href="#FNanchor_389" class="label">[389]</a> <i>Poggii Hist. de Variet. Fortunæ, p. 3.</i> From the prefatory remarks
which Poggio prefixed to his version of the Cyropædia, and which are quoted by
Bandini, in his <i>Catalogus Bibliothecæ, Laurentianæ, tom. ii. p. 351</i>, it should
seem, that by omitting many of the dialogues and speeches, he had considerably
abridged the work of Xenophon, whose eight books he had compressed into six.
An Italian translation of Poggio’s version of the Cyropædia, made by his son
Jacopo, was published at Florence by the Junta, <i>an.</i> 1521. It is worthy of
remark, that Poggio was the first literary character who declared his opinion
(an opinion now generally entertained) that the Cyropædia is not a history, but
a political romance. <i>Ton. Tr. vol. ii. p. 108.</i></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_391" href="#FNanchor_391" class="label">[391]</a> Bartolomeo Facio was a native of Spezia, a sea-port in the Genoese territory.
The most curious inquirers into the history of literature have not yet
been able to ascertain the precise period of his birth. From many passages however
which occur in his works it appears, that he was indebted for instruction
in the Latin and Greek languages to Guarino Veronese, whom he frequently
mentions in terms of affectionate esteem. Facio was one of the numerous
assemblage of scholars that rendered illustrious the court of Alfonso, king of
Naples, by whom he was treated with distinguished honour. During his
residence at Naples, the jealousy of rivalship betrayed him into a violent quarrel
with Lorenzo Valla, against whom he composed four invectives. The following
list of his other works is extracted from his life, prefixed by Mehus to an edition
of his treatise <i>De Viris illustribus</i>, published at Florence, <i>an.</i> 1745.</p>

<p>1. <i>De bello Veneto Clodiano ad Joannem Jacobum Spinulam Liber.
Lugd. 1568.</i></p>

<p>2. <i>Aliud parvi temporis bellum Venetum</i> was printed together with the
former.</p>

<p>3. <i>De humanæ vitæ felicitate ad Alphonsum Arragonum et Siciliæ
regem. Hanoviæ, typis Vechelianis, 1611. Post epitomen Felini Sandei de
Regibus Siciliæ, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>4. <i>De excellentiâ et præstantiâ hominis.</i> This work, which is erroneously
ascribed to Pius II., was printed together with the preceding treatise, <i>Hanoviæ,
1611</i>.</p>

<p>5. <i>De rebus gestis ab Alphonso primo Neapolitanorum rege Commentariorum,
Libri x. Lugduni, 1560, apud hæredes Sebastiani Gryphii, in 4to.</i>—<i>Ibidem,
1562 &amp; 1566.</i> The seven first books of this work were also published,
<i>Mantuæ, anno 1563, a Francisco Philopono</i>. It has also been reprinted in
various collections of Italian history.</p>

<p>6. <i>Arriani de rebus gestis Alexandri, Libri viii. Latine redditi. Basileæ,
1539. in fo. a Roberto Winter.</i> <i>Pisauri, 1508.</i> <i>Lugduni, 1552.</i></p>

<p>7. <i>Epistolæ.</i> Several of Facio’s epistles are subjoined by Mehus to his
edition of the treatise <i>De Viris illus</i>. It is justly observed by Tiraboschi, that
Facio’s style is much more elegant than that of any of his contemporaries.

on occasion of this quarrel took place between Poggio and George of Trebisond
in Pompey’s theatre. This story was related as a fact in the first edition of
this work; but, on further reflection, I agree in opinion with my Italian translator,
that it is a fiction. See <i>Tonelli, vol. ii. p. 114.</i></p>

occasioned by the celebration of this jubilee experienced only one interruption,
which was occasioned by the following accident. As an innumerable multitude
of people were returning on the nineteenth of December from receiving the pontifical
benediction, they were on a sudden so much alarmed by the braying of
an ass, that they trampled upon each other in such precipitate disorder, that
upwards of two hundred perished in the throng.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_404" href="#FNanchor_404" class="label">[404]</a> Antonio Lusco was celebrated for his knowledge of the civil law, which
procured him the honour of being selected as a proper person to assist Francesco
Barbaro in revising the municipal regulations of the city of Vicenza. In the
course of his journey to that place he overtook a Venetian, in whose company
he rode to Siena, where they took up their lodgings for the night. The inn was
crowded with travellers, who, on the ensuing morning, were busily employed in
getting their horses out of the stable in order to pursue their journey. In the
midst of the bustle, Lusco observed his Venetian friend booted and spurred,
but sitting with great tranquillity at the door of the inn. Surprised at seeing
him thus inactive, he told him, that if he wished to become his fellow traveller
for that day’s journey, he must make haste, as he was just going to mount; on
which the Venetian said, “I should be happy to accompany you, but I do not
recollect which is my horse, and I am waiting till the other guests are gone,
in order that I may take the beast which is left.” This anecdote Lusco
communicated to his fellow secretaries; and Poggio did not fail to insert it in
his <i>Facetiæ</i>. The horsemanship of the Venetians appears to have been a fruitful
subject of mirth to the frequenters of the <i>Bugiale</i>. The following story
proves what utter ignorance of equestrian affairs the wits of the pontifical chancery
imputed to that amphibious race of men. “As a Venetian,” says Poggio,
“was travelling to Trivigi on a hired horse, attended by a running footman, the
servant received a kick from the beast, and in the first emotion of pain took
up a stone and threw it at the aggressor; but missing his aim, he hit his
master on the loins. The master looking back, and seeing his attendant
limping after him at some distance, asked him why he did not quicken his
pace. The servant excused himself by saying, that the horse had kicked him:
on which his master replied, I see he is a vicious beast, for he has just now
given me a severe kick on the back.” <i>Agostini Istoria degli Scrit. Viniz.

<p>For the following enumeration of the <i>Facetiæ</i> of Poggio, which appear to
correspond with some of the <i>Fabliaux</i>, I am indebted to the friendly diligence
of the late Rev. John Greswell, for many years master of the college school at
Manchester.</p>

<p>The first occurs in <i>tom. i. p. 299</i> of the <i>Fabliaux</i>, entitled <i>La Culotte des
Cordeliers</i>, and is, with some variations in the commencement, the <i>Braccæ
Divi Francisci</i> of Poggio, <i>p. 236</i> of the small edition of 1798. In <i>vol. iii. p.
107</i>, <i>Le Testament de l’Ane</i>, is in Poggio’s <i>Facet.</i> <i>p. 45, Canis Testamentum</i>.
Same vol. <i>p. 197</i>, <i>Du Villain et de sa femme</i>, is in Poggio, <i>p. 69</i>, the <i>Mulier
Demersa</i>, whose body is to be sought for as floating against the current, <i>vol. iii.
p. 201</i>. <i>Du pré tondu, alias De la femme contrariante</i>, is the <i>Pertinacia
Muliebris</i> in the <i>Facetiæ</i>, <i>p. 68</i>. Again, <i>vol. iii. p. 292</i>, <i>Le Meunier d’Aleus</i>,
is in Poggio the story entitled <i>Quinque Ova</i>, <i>p. 278</i> of the <i>Facetiæ</i>. <i>Vol. iv.
p. 192</i>, <i>Le Villain de Baïlleul, alias La femme qui fit croire à son Mari
qu’il étoit mort</i>, is mentioned as imitated by Poggio, but resembles his <i>Mortuus
loquens</i>, <i>p. 275</i>, only at the close. In Poggio, the young man persuaded that
he was dead, hearing himself abused during the procession of his corpse to burial,
<i>erecto capite, si vivus essem, sicut sum mortuus, inquit, dicerem, furcifer, te
per gulam mentiri</i>. In <i>le Villain de Baïlleul</i>, the husband persuaded by his
wife that he is dead, Le Curé lui-méme entre pour chanter ses <i>oremus</i> aprés quoi
il emmene la veuve dan la chambre. Pendant tout ce tems le Villain convaincu
qu’il était mort, restait toujours sous le drap, sans remuer non plus qu’un cadavre.
Mais entendant un certain bruit dans la chambre, et soulevant son linceul
pour regarder: coquin de Pretre s’ecrie-t-il, tu dois bien remercier Dieu de ce
que je suis mort, car sans cela, mordie, tu perirais ici sous le baton. <i>Vol. iii.
p. 287</i>, <i>De la Bourgeoise d’Orléans, alias De la dame qui fit battre son Mari</i>,
is said to be imitated in Poggio’s <i>Fraus Muliebris</i>, <i>p. 20</i>, but with much
variation. <i>Vol. iv. p. 304</i>, <i>De l’Anneau ... (Par Haisiau)</i>. All the
account of this is as follows: Quoique le grave President Fauchet ait donné
l’extrait de ce <i>Fabliau</i>, je n’en parlerais point si je n’avais à remarquer sur
celuici, comme sur le précédent qu’il a été imité. Ou le trouve dans Vergier
sous le titre de <i>l’Anneau de Merlin</i>. This is the <i>Annulus</i> which Poggio
(<i>Facet. p. 141</i>) gives Philephus.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, <i>Le Médecin de Bral, aliàs le Villain dévenu
Médecin</i>, <i>tom. ii. p. 366</i>, from which Moliere has borrowed his <i>Médecin malgré
lui</i>, is in some parts imitated in the <i>Poggiana</i>, where an account is given of an
expeditious method of clearing the sick list of an hospital on his estate, by an
Italian cardinal. Deguisé en Médecin il leur declara qu’ on ne pouvait les
guerir qu’ avec un onguent de graisse humaine, mais des qu’il eut proposé de
tirer au sort à qui serait mis dans la chaudiere, tous viderent l’hôpital. <i>Vol. iii.
p. 95</i>, <i>Les deux Parasites</i>, (une assez mauvaise plaisanterie) in the <i>Facetiæ</i>
of Frischlinus is attributed to Poggio, and is in his <i>Facetiæ</i>, <i>p. 67</i>, <i>Danthis
Faceta Responsio</i>. When Dante was dining with Canis Scaliger, the courtiers
had privately placed all the <i>bones</i> before him. Versi omnes in solum Dantem,
mirabantur cur ante ipsum solummodo ossa conspicerentur, tum ille, Minimè
inquit mirum, si Canes ossa sua commederunt; ego autem non sum <i>Canis</i>.
Le Grand does not notice this as contained in the <i>Facetiæ</i> of Poggio; but the
resemblance is as great as between most of those that he notices.</p>

<p>The popularity of the <i>Facetiæ</i> is evinced by the number of editions through
which that work has passed; seven different impressions of it are thus enumerated
by De Bure, who erroneously gives to Poggio the prœnomen of Franciscus.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_421" href="#FNanchor_421" class="label">[421]</a> <i>Muratori Annali, tom. ix. p. 456.</i> It may be mentioned as a striking
instance of the liberty which was granted by personages of the most exalted
eminence to scholars of celebrity in the fifteenth century, that Poggio at various
times addressed letters to his patron, cardinal Beaufort, to prince John Corrinus,
Waiwode of Hungary, to the duke of Viseo, brother to Edward, king of Portugal,
and also to Alfonso, king of Naples, exhorting them to active exertions
against the Turks, who at this time threatened to overrun some of the finest
countries of Europe. These letters still exist in the Riccardi MS. <i>Ton. Tr.

be given to Valla’s own assertion, his introduction into the world was announced
in a supernatural manner. He boasts in his <i>Antidotus</i>, <i>p. 191</i>, that his mother
being ignorant that she was pregnant, was apprized of that circumstance by the
interposition of an oracle, which informed her that she would be brought to
bed of a son, and gave particular directions with respect to her offspring’s name.
It might have been reasonably conjectured that this oracle was some experienced
matron; but by the subsequent part of Valla’s narration, it seems that the
important admonition in question proceeded from one of the saints.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_433" href="#FNanchor_433" class="label">[433]</a> The passage which thus irritated the feeling of the Catalonian nobleman
occurs in Poggio’s epistle to Andreolo Giustiniano, in which he remarks, upon
the assertion of Francesco di Pistoia, that some Catalans had stolen a marble
statue which he had in charge to deliver to Poggio: “in quo ut conjicio manifeste
mentitus fuit. Non enim marmoria sculpti Cathalani cupidi sunt, sed

<p><a id="Footnote_434" href="#FNanchor_434" class="label">[434]</a> This attack on Poggio’s moral character occurs in the proemium to the
<i>Antidotus</i>, and is couched in the following atrocious terms. “Ostendam itaque
eum quasi alterum Regulum, malum quidem virum, non quod libidinosus ac
prope libidinis professor, non quod adulter atquo adeo alienarum uxorum
præreptor, non quod vinolentus semper ac potius temulentus, non quod falsarius
et quidem convictus, non quod avarus, sacrilegus, perjurus, corruptor,
spurcus, aliaque quæ extra nostram causam sunt, sed quatenus ad causam
nostram facit, quod manifestarius calumniator.”—<i>Antidotus, p. 8.</i></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_435" href="#FNanchor_435" class="label">[435]</a> He asserted, that during Valla’s residence at Pavia, he forged a receipt
in order to evade the payment of a sum of money which he had borrowed,
and that by way of punishment for this offence, he was exposed to public view
with a mitre of paper upon his head. Poggio, in his relation of this anecdote,
made use of the following ironical expression. “Falsum chirographum cum
scripsisses, accusatus, convictus, damnatus, ante tempus legitimum absque
ullâ dispensatione episcopus factus es.” This witticism of Poggio’s betrayed
Monsieur L’Enfant into a very ridiculous error. “On trouve ici,” says he, in
gravely commenting on this passage, “une particularité assez curieuse de la
vie de Laurent Valla. C’est qu’ayant été ordonné Eveque à Pavie avant
l’age et sans dispense, il quitta de lui même la mitre, et la deposa, en attendant
dans le palais episcopal, où elle étoit encore. Je rapporterai ses paroles
en Latin qui sont fort embrouillées.” <i>Poggiana, tom. i. p. 212.</i> On this
statement of L’Enfant, Recanati, in his <i>Osservazioni</i>, <i>p. 111</i>, makes the
following dry remark. “Non credo però, che l’autore della Poggiana, quando
pure fosse Cattolico, vorrebbe essere fatto <i>Vescovo</i> in questa foggia, come
Poggio dice che il Valla lo sia stato.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_436" href="#FNanchor_436" class="label">[436]</a> To enter into the particulars of Poggio’s charges and Valla’s defence
would be a most disgusting task. The following circumstance is, however, too
curious to be passed over without notice. Poggio reprobating the incontinence
of his adversary, accused him of debauching his sister’s maid-servant. In reply
to this accusation, Valla did not deny the fact; but with wonderful ingenuity
thus converted it into a proof of his principled chastity. “Itaque cum nonnulli
meorum propinquorum me virginem, sive frigidioris naturæ, et ob id
non idoneum conjugio arbitrarentur, quorum unus erat vir sororis, quodammodo
experiri cupiebant. Volui itaque eis ostendere, id quod facerem, non
vitium esse corporis, sed animi virtutem.” <i>Antidotus, p. 222.</i></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_439" href="#FNanchor_439" class="label">[439]</a> <i>Filelfi Opera, p. 75.</i> On the death of the duke of Milan, Filelfo had
experienced considerable inconvenience, in consequence of the war between
Francesco Sforza and the Milanese. In the course of this contest he wavered
between the two parties; but the success of Sforza at length attached him to the
interests of that enterprising chieftain. Soon after the elevation of Nicolas V. to
the pontificate, Filelfo was invited by Alfonso, king of Naples, to present to him
in person a copy of his satires. On his way to Naples he passed through Rome,
where he paid his respects to the pontiff, who endeavoured, but in vain, to retain
him in his service by the promise of a liberal stipend. On his arrival at the
Neapolitan capital, he was received with great kindness by Alfonso, at whose
command he was crowned with laurel in the midst of the camp. From Naples
he returned to Milan, where he received the afflicting intelligence, that at the
sack of Constantinople by the Turks, Manfredina Doria, his mother-in-law,
and two of her daughters had been carried away captives. It is an astonishing
instance of the power of song, that he procured their redemption by an ode
addressed to Mahomet II. In the year 1454, he was reconciled to Cosmo de’
Medici, by whose son Pietro he was treated with distinguished regard. During
the life of Francesco Sforza, Filelfo was enabled, by the munificence of that
prince, to live in a state of splendor which was very congenial to his dispositions;
but on the death of that generous patron he received from his successor, Galeazzo
Maria, little more than empty promises. In consequence of the pressure of
distress, he undertook at the age of seventy-two to read lectures on Aristotle.
After sustaining a variety of afflictions in consequence of the distracted state into
which Milan was thrown by the death of Galeazzo, he received from Lorenzo de’
Medici an invitation to read lectures on the Greek language at Florence. This
invitation he gladly accepted, and at the advanced age of eighty-three he repaired
to the Tuscan capital, for the purpose of resuming the task of public instruction.
The fatigues of his journey however overpowered the strength of his constitution,
and soon after his arrival in Florence he closed a life of assiduous study, and
of almost ceaseless turbulence.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_445" href="#FNanchor_445" class="label">[445]</a> By his wife, Poggio had five sons; Pietro Paulo, Giovanni Battista,
Jacopo, Giovanni Francesco, and Filippo. Pietro Paulo was born in the year
1438. He entered into the fraternity of the Dominicans, and was promoted to
the honourable office of Prior of Santa Maria ad Minervam, in Rome, which
office he held till the time of his death, which happened September 6th, 1464.</p>

<p>Giovanni Battista, who was born in the year 1439, took the degree of doctor
of civil and canon law, and attained the several dignities of Canonico of Florence,
and of Arezzo, Rector of the Lateran church, Acolyte of the pontiff,
and assistant clerk of the chamber. He composed in the Latin language the
lives of Niccolo Piccinino, and Dominico Capranica, cardinal of Firmiano.
He died anno 1570.</p>

<p>Jacopo, born anno 1441, was the only one of Poggio’s sons who did not enter
into the ecclesiastical profession. He was a scholar of distinguished accomplishments.
His Italian translation of his father’s History of Florence, and of
his Latin version of the Cyropædia, have already been noticed. He also translated
into Italian the lives of four of the Roman emperors. Nor did he confine
his literary exertions to translations. He composed a commentary on Petrarca’s
Triumph of Fame, which he dedicated to Lorenzo de’ Medici; a treatise on the
origin of the War between the English and the French; and the life of Filippo
Scolario, vulgarly called Pipo Spano. Entering into the service of cardinal
Riario, he was involved in the guilt of the Pazzi conspiracy, and was of the
number of the criminals who were suspended from the windows of the town hall
of Florence, in the year 1478.</p>

<p>Giovanni Francesco, who was born anno 1447, after holding the offices of
Canonico of Florence, and Rector of the Lateran church, went to Rome, where
he became chamberlain of the pontiff, and abbreviator of the apostolic epistles.
He was highly esteemed by Leo X., who appointed him his secretary, in the enjoyment
of which office he died at Rome, July 25th, 1522, and was buried in
the church of St. Gregory, where there still exists a monument erected to his
memory.</p>

<p>Filippo was born anno 1450. When he had attained the twentieth year of
his age he was created Canonico of Florence. But quitting the ecclesiastical
life, he married a lady of an illustrious family, by whom he had three daughters.</p>

<p>Besides these five sons, Poggio had a daughter, named Lucretia, who married
into the family of the Buondelmonti. <i>Ton. Tr. tom. ii. p. 169.</i></p>

certain alterations made in the façade of the church of Santa Maria, in the year
1560, by Francesco, Grand duke of Tuscany, it was removed to another part of
that edifice, where it now composes one of the group of the twelve
apostles.—<i>Recanati Vita Poggii, p. xxxiv.</i></p>
